#Discussion Question 1#

Please note that answers will be shared with your peers after the due date. 

You will find in this module a short [video clip](http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi329318937) from a Star Trek episode, 'The Measure of a Man.' In this episode, the characters are debating the status of an android, Data. Is Data a person? Or is he merely an automaton? Riker, the commander in the red outfit, argues that Data is not a person. In this discussion question, you will be analyzing that argument in some detail. 

### Instructions

+ This assignment should be completed after you have completeed the assigned reading, studied the notes, and tried the self-assessment exercises. 

+ Submit your answer through Blackboard by 07/13/15 @ 1:00 pm.

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

### Due Date
Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

### Format
Please submit the file as either a word file or simple .rtf file will also suffice.

### Word Count


### Prompt


1. Introduce yourself to me and your peers. Tell us what you are majoring in (or intend to major in) and also about why you decided to study philosophy. (This part of your submission is not graded.)  
2. In 150 to 200 words, analyze Riker's argument. 

###Clarification

Analyzing an argument has several steps: 

+ Identify the conclusion that Riker is arguing for. I'll give you this one---he is arguing that Data, the android, is not a person. 

+ Identify the premises in Riker's argument. What evidence does he provide for his claim?

+ Determine if the argument is valid. Can you imagine a situation in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false? If so, the conclusion does not follow from the premises---the argument is not valid. (If you don't know what validity is, you need to review the textbook and notes.) 

+ Discuss whether the premises are true or false. Give reasons for your answers.
