title: Free Will 2

## Review

Recall that the argument against free will relies on two claims, one a general claim that applies to all events in the universe, a second a claim about what free will would require of us. 

Causal determinism:
: Given a specified way things are at a time *t*, everything which happens at a time later than *t* is fixed as a matter of natural law.

Free Will:
: An agent, S, freely chooses to do F at time *t1* if and only if it was S's power at time *t1* to bring either F or not F about. 

Causal determinism says that states of the universe, including what you are doing at any particular time, are completely determined by how the universe was in the past, even the far far past, plus the laws of nature. If that's true, then anything I do is causally determined, it is already determined how what I will choose and how I will act---I cannot choose otherwise than I do. But free will requires that my choices and actions are not determined. It requires that I, myself, have the power to choose otherwise than I do. So, it appears that these two claims are incompatible. 


## Compatibilism 
Last week we discussed the compatibilist response. They argue that we misconstrued the nature of Free Will. All that is require for an action to be free, they claim, is that it arises from our own character, from the inside, and not from external sources. In other words, they deny that free will requires the power to do otherwise. 

### Objections 1 & 2
Here are two puzzling features of the compatibilist's view. I'll raise a stronger objection below. 

1. Note the distinction between freely *acting* a certain way and freely *choosing* to act a certain way. Compatibilists are claiming you act freely when your actions arise from your character. You do not freely choose to act that way. But can your actions be free if you do not freely choose them? 

2. Since the compatibilist accepts causal determinism, they accept that your character is determined by the past. Your character was shaped by preceding causes. This character causes you to behave in certain way. If your character is determined by circumstances outside your control, are the actions that arise from your character free? 

### Objection 3---Situationism 

The compatibilist is committed to the claim that we have character traits that are robust, stable, and integrated with one another. But there is strong evidence that there are no such traits at all. 

Psychologists have been concerned to decide when the features of the situation we are in rather than our character traits cause our behavior. Some have argued that all our behavior is caused by external factors. On this view, there are no character traits whatsoever: 


> "... modern experimental psychology has discovered that circumstance has surprisingly more to do with how people behave than traditional images of character and virtue allow (John Doris 2002, ix)."

Gilbert Harman expresses this idea as follows:

> In trying to characterize and explain a distinctive action, ordinary thinking tends to hypothesize a corresponding distinctive characteristic of the agent and tends to overlook the relevant details of the agent's perceived situation.... Ordinary attributions of character traits to people are often deeply misguided and it may even be the case that there... [are] no ordinary traits of the sort people think there are (Harman 1999, 315f).


The strongest version of the view is called Situationism, which makes three central claims:

1. Non-robustness claim: character traits are not robust. They are not consistent across a wide spectrum of trait-relevant situations. 
2. Consistency claim: while a person's behavior may be stable over time, this is due to the consistency of situation specific traits rather than robust traits, e.g., students might tell the truth to friends, but not teacher. 
3. Fragmentation claim: a person's character traits do not have the evaluative integrity suggested by the integrity claim. There may be considerable disunity in a person's character among her situation-specific character traits.


There is empirical evidence, the situationist claims, for each of their claims: 

+ The by-stander effect shows many traits are not stable. Find a short video about that effect [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSsPfbup0ac&spfreload=1)
+ The famous experiments by Stanley Milgram showed that terrible behavior seems caused by circumstance rather than terrible characters. Find a short video about one such experiment [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6GxIuljT3w)
+ Hugh Hartshorne and M. A. May's study of the trait of honesty among school children found no cross-situational correlation. A child may be consistently honest with his friends, but not with his parents or teachers. From this and other studies, Hartshorne and May concluded that character traits are not robust but rather "specific functions of life situations" (Hartshorne and May 1928, 379f). 


Other studies further question the integrity claim. In one experiment persons who found a dime in a phone booth were more likely to help someone who dropped some papers than were those who did not find a dime. Another experiment involved seminary students who agreed to give a talk on the importance of helping those in need. On the way to the building where their talks were to be given, they encountered a confederate slumped over and groaning. Those who were told they were already late were much less likely to help than those who were told they had time to spare. These experiments are taken to show that minor factors without moral significance (finding a dime, being in a hurry) are strongly correlated with people's helping behavior.


## Libertarianism

Libertarianism a radically different response to the free will problem. Libertarians reject the weakened view of free will offered by the compatibilist and argue that the existence of our ability to free choose is evidence that causal determinism is false. Libertarians are committed to the following 4 claims: 

1.  Free will & causal determinism are incompatible. 
2.  Free will requires that we have the power to *choose* between alternative possibilities...(emphasis on freedom of will and not merely of action)
3.  Causal determinism is false.
4.  We sometimes act freely. 

The key claim is, of course, 3. Libertarians accept that free will jars with causal determinism, but they take this as evidence that  causal determinism is false. They offer two different arguments for 3.  The first argues that humans are not purely physical creatures and so causal determinism does not apply to us. The second argues that proper attention to physics shows that causal determinism is false. I will consider both options in reverse order. 

### Option 2-Physicalism

Our first version of Libertarianism claims that proper attention to physics shows that causal determinism is false. While they agree that the physics of Newton and his predecessors were deterministic ones, they point out that modern physics are not deterministic. 

According to classical physics, exact, simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities, e.g., at each moment, each particle has an exact position and an exact momentum. 

In contrast, quantum physics says that no exact, simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities, e.g., no exact value can be assigned to both the position and momentum of each particle: the more precisely the position (momentum) of a particle is given, the less precisely can one say what its momentum (position) is. 

Causal determinism seems to require classical physics, which says that the state of the universe is determined by the fixed state of the universe at some previous time plus the law of nature. But quantum [hysics tells us that the state of universe at each time is not totally fixed!!! 

**Problem:** We are not sub-atomic particles. How does the failure of causal determinism at the microscopic level, show that causal determinism is false at the macroscopic level?


### Option 2-Dualism

1. The mind/soul/will is not reducible to anything physical.
2. The mind/soul/will is at least partially the cause of some of our actions. 
3. Thus, some of our actions have non-physical causes. 
4. Thus, some of our actions are not causally determined. 

**Problem 1:** How could a non-physical being be the cause of something physical? 

**Problem 2:** What evidence is there that we are non-physical? 

Both problems will be the focus of our next module when we discuss the relationship between mind and body.
