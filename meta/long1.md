## Introduction

You have written several short essays so far. For this assignment, you will pick one of the questions below and write a longer, standard research paper for it. The paper must be appropriately structured, have a clear thesis statement, include citations and a bibliography, and generally conform to the standard norms of an intermediate college level course. 

You will be assessed on how you use the reading that was assigned for the topic (as well as any other *academic* sources you would like to use). Reddit, wikipedia, quora, blogs, etc., are obviously not academic sources and you will be penalized if you use them--I use software to check papers for such use. 

You should devote significant time to researching your topic. Start early. Ask the librarians for help to identify material. Discuss drafts and ideas for your paper with me---see my website for office hours. 

**Important details:**

+ Word count: 1000--1250 words. Note that your word count does not include the bibliography, headers, or citations. It includes only the body of your paper. 
+ Due date: 11/13/2017 at noon through Blackboard. 
+ Point: 20 points towards your final grade. 
+ Citation style: use MLA, Chicago, or APA. It's up to you, but be consistent throughout.

Explain what Aristotle means by this, with reference to his account of change and coming-into-being in Physics I. Does Aristotle's response succeed? Give reasons for your answer.

**Prompt 2:** Protagoras claims that man is the measure of all things, of the things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not. How does Aristotle understand Protagoras' claim and how does he think that Protagoras' argues for it? What is Aristotle's response? Does it succeed? Give reasons for your answer.

**Prompt 3:** As charitably and forcefully as you can, present a reconstruction of Zeno’s arrow paradox. How does the at-at theory of motion purport to solve this paradox? Is that solution successful? Give reasons for your answer.
