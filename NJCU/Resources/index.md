### Major/Minor Information

+ [Major requirements:](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3478322/RequirementsGenED.pdf) Please emphasize to students that substitutions can be made to accommodate those who began on the old General Studies Program.

### General Education Program

The new General Education Program significantly diverges from the old General Studies Program. One of the main goals of the new program is to help students make progress towards several learning goals. So, these are skill based courses, not content based courses. As such, general introductions to topics in the major are unsuitable. Unmodified Gen. Studies courses are also unsuitable. Please see below for further information: 

+ [NJCU's General Education website](http://www.njcu.edu/cas/general-education/)
+ [Approved philosophy/religion courses:](Approved) The approved proposals include information on the learning goals that must be taught regardless of instructor.
+ [Syllabi templates for approved philosophy/religion courses:](Templates) Please consider using these templates to ensure essential information is provided for accreditation purposes. It will also save you time.
+ [Sample syllabi for approved courses:](Syllabi) Please consider sharing your own syllabi.
+ [General Education rubrics:](Rubrics) These explain the various learning goals/outcomes that you are teaching in your courses. 
+ [Sample Signature Assignments:](Sig) Every General Education course must include a signature assignment that examines the learning outcomes included in the original proposal. Please consider sharing the assignments you write.
+ [TK20:  Faculty Guide:](http://www.njcu.edu/uploadedFiles/Academics/Colleges/College_of_Art_and_Sciences/General_Education/Faculty%20Navigation%20Guide%20-%20Gen%20Ed%20Signature%20Assignments%20-%20v.11.30.2015.pdf) Signature assignments are uploaded to the TK-20 site. Read the guide for more infomration.
+ [TK20: Signature Assignment Submission Form:](http://www.njcu.edu/uploadedFiles/Academics/Colleges/College_of_Art_and_Sciences/General_Education/Signature%20Assignment%20Submission%20Form.docx) Please note that students will upload their signature assignment using this form. They must fill it out once per learning outcome. (I am hoping that the General Education Curriculum Committee finds a more streamlined way of doing this.)
