## NJCU Philosophy/Religion Instructor Resources

Please let me know if there is any other relevant information I could list here. 

### Major/Minor Requirements

+ [Students who joined NJCU before Fall 2015 and transfer students](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3478322/OldrequirementsMajor.pdf)
+ [Non-transfer students who began during or after Fall 2015](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3478322/RequirementsGenED.pdf)

### General Education Program

General information can be found here: 

+ [NJCU's General Education Website](http://www.njcu.edu/cas/general-education/)

Information about approved philosophy courses can be found here:

+ [Approved Courses](Approved)
+ [Syllabi Templates](Templates)
+ [Sample Syllabi](Syllabi)

Every General Education course must include a signature assignment that examines the learning outcomes included in the original proposal. These assignments will be uploaded to an anonymous TK20 site. Information below: 

+ [Sample Signature Assignments](Sig)
+ [TK20:  Faculty Guide ](http://www.njcu.edu/uploadedFiles/Academics/Colleges/College_of_Art_and_Sciences/General_Education/Faculty%20Navigation%20Guide%20-%20Gen%20Ed%20Signature%20Assignments%20-%20v.11.30.2015.pdf)
+ [TK20: Signature Assignment Submission Form:](http://www.njcu.edu/uploadedFiles/Academics/Colleges/College_of_Art_and_Sciences/General_Education/Signature%20Assignment%20Submission%20Form.docx) Please note that students will upload their signature assignment using this form. They must fill it out once per learning outcome. (I am hoping that the General Education Curriculum Committee finds a more streamlined way of doing this.)
