This course introduces students to basic ethical reasoning. Starting out from real-life situations, students analyze ethical problems by conceptualizing the moral intuitions and beliefs they already possess. With the help of short philosophical readings, they develop methods of applying ethical theories to moral decision-making in their disciplines and own lives.

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) analyze moral decision situations, such as provided in case studies, (ii) define basic ethical concepts and ideas, (iii) interpret short passages from philosophical texts, (iv) apply ethical concepts and ideas to real-life situations, (v) compare competing ethical perspectives in their application to real-life situations,  (vi) examined the ethical dimensions of their own conduct, (vii) determine some social, economic, and political implications of moral reasoning.
