\section{Catalog Description}

This course explores our relationship with food through the lens of philosophy. Using ethics, logic and critical thinking, we investigate current debates and examine how collective choices impact the health of the planet. Using these insights, we develop a community action program that empowers an underserved community.

\section{Discipline Specific Learning Outcomes}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) analyze ethical choices. For example, students will see how personal consumption contributes to global health. (ii) Integrate philosophical concepts with pragmatic examples. For example, how might the idea of eternal and unchanging Platonic forms be reconciled with new GMO hybrids? (iii) Evaluate food research and journalism using the tools of philosophy, informal logic and critical thinking. (iv) Apply ethical concepts and ethical thought to the realm of food and food policy. (v) Compare competing ethical perspectives as they apply to food and food policy. (vi) Appraise arguments that relate to food innovation and the pursuit of progress. (vii)  Develop a stronger sense of empathy and personal responsibility regarding other people, cultures and the overall health and sustainability of the planet.
