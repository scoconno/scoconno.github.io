## For Students 
If you are enrolled in a course, please check the syllabus before contacting me. Many students contact me with questions that are already answered in the relevant syllabus. If you do contact me, please use the Blackboard messaging app. That app allows me to keep track of all messages for a particular course and is easier to use than email. It also allows me to easily comply with the Federal Law concerning the privacy of student education records (FERPA). If you are not currently enrolled in one of my courses, please email me. 

### General email etiquette 

+ If you must use email, use your NJCU email account. To comply with Federal Law, I will hesitate to respond to non-NJCU email addresses. 
	+ Find out how to set up your NJCU email on iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch [here.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-iPhone-iPad-or-iPod-Touch-b2de2161-cc1d-49ef-9ef9-81acd1c8e234#BKMK_WorkOrSchool)
	+ Find out how to set up your NJCU email on an Android phone or tablet [here.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-an-Android-phone-or-tablet-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872#BKMK_O365SetUp) 
+ Keep the body of your message brief and to the point. If it’s longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead.
+ Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure.
+ Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentence.  Avoid text-speak and emoticons. 
+ Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor’s name]).
+ End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name.
+ Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example.

Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing.
