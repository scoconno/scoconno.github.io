## Introduction

Turing believed that the ability to pass the Turing Test was both necessary and sufficient for mentality. You will be challenging both these claims (see below). I do not want you to read anything other than the textbook and the materials I have included on the website. Do watch the videos I included there too. Include citations and reference, but feel free to pick your citation format.  

## Task

Your paper should have 4 distinct parts. Each part should receive at least one good paragraph: 

1. State what it would be for the Turing Test to provide a necessary condition for mentality. 
2. Set out a reason to believe that the Turing Test does not provides a necessary condition for mentality.
3. State what it would be for the Turing Test to provide a sufficient condition for mentality. 
4. Set out a reason to believe that the Turing Test does not provide a sufficient condition for mentality. 
	   

**NB:** Failure to complete any of these tasks will result in a loss of points. 


## Word Count

Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.


## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

## Format
Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.
