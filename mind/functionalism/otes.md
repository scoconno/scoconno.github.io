## Review

Let us take stock. We have reviewed three theories of mind so far. 

Dualism:
: mental states are separate from brain states. For instance, dualists claim that pain is not identical to any brain state. 

Identity Theory:
: mental states are identical to brain states. For instance, identity theorists claim that pain is identical to some brain state like c-fibers firing. 

Behaviorism: 
: each mental state is identical to some specific set of behaviors and physiological responses. For instance, the behaviorist claims that pain is identical to some behavior like grimacing and groaning. 

We saw that dualists struggle to explain mental causation, to explain how the mind causes our bodies to move. We saw the identity theorist has little difficult explaining mental causation, but struggles to explain how all the properties of our minds could really be properties of our brain. And, we saw that the behaviorist struggles to explain several features of mentality, including how mental states figure in the explanation of our behaviors. 

## Functionalism
Our final theory of mind is called **functionalism**. It is also currently the most popular of the various theories of mind. Functionalism hopes to accommodate the strengths of all our previous theories while avoiding their weaknesses. We will define functionalism as follows: 

Functionalism: 
: mental states are defined by the causal roles they play in the cognitive system as a whole, i.e., what it is to be a particular state just is to bring about some result given some input.

Let's unpack this definition. What does it mean to define something by a causal role? There are many functions and roles that entities play. You may have a job and that job will have a description, e.g., what it is to be a full time professor is to *conduct research in their field*, *teach courses in their field*, and *contribute to the running of their department, college, and university*. Each of these italicized phrases describe jobs that full time professors have. Different job titles exist: contingent faculty teach courses in their fields but do not contribute to the running of their department, college, and university. Take a moment and consider any job you have had. Write out what *work* that job required of you; that work is the function that defines the job category. Notice that what you must wear or what time you must start are not part of the work you do; they may be requirement of the job, but they are not what defines the job. What defines the job is the work that it requires of you.  

Functional definitions are often confusing because some phrases and terms admit of both a functional and non-functional definition. For instance, what do you think hearts are? If you had to define a heart, what would you say? You likely gave one of two types of answers: 

Functional Definition:
: To be a heart is to pump oxygenated blood to the tissues and deoxygenated blood to the lungs. 

Material Definition: 
: To be a heart is to be a hollow muscular organ that has four chambers with two atria and two ventricles.

Our first definition describes the job or role that hearts perform. It makes no mention about the structure of the heart, about its parts and the materials it is constituted from. The second definition only mentions the structure and constitution of the heart; it says nothing about what the heart does. 

Which of these two definitions states the true nature of the heart? A functionalist about hearts claims it is the first. They believe this because they think that all of the following count equally as hearts"

Each item is composed of different materials. Some are composed of tissues. Others are composed of metals and plastics. But each of these entities can pump oxygenated blood to the tissues and deoxygenated blood to the lungs; you could have an artificial heart. According to the functionalist, since each plays the role described in the functional definition of a heart, they are each hearts. So, regardless of what it is made of, it is a heart if it does the job of a heart. 

You shouldn't find this too surprising. A person counts as occupying a position at a company if it is their job to the work associated with that position. They do not count as occupying the position because they have blood and tissue as parts, or because they are a certain height, weight, or appearance. Such considerations do not define a job; it's the work that defines the job and people of varying heights, weights, and appearance can often do the work that describes some position. 

The functionalist thinks that we need to be similarly careful when investigating the nature of the mind to distinguish between functional and physical descriptions of mental states. The identity theorist, for instance, really thinks that mental states are best captured by some physical description; they think that a mental state is identical to what composes it. But the functionalist disagrees. They think that the nature of a mental state is the job it plays; the nature of a mental state is defined by a functional role and not what constitutes it. 

Consider pain. What job does pain play? That might seem an odd question, but pain does play a role, a role that even has a rich evolutionary history. Namely, when your body detects tissue damage, pain is that mental state which causes you to respond appropriately, e.g. causes you to remove your  hand from the burning object. On this view, the pain state exists and it is defined by the job that it does, namely, disposing you to behave in a certain way given the detection of tissue damage. Pain is also distinct from any behavior for pain, on this view, is whatever causes you to behave in some distinctive way upon the detection of tissue damage. Pain is also distinct from any physical state. Just as what it is to be heart is not to be made of tissues, so too what it is to be pain is not to be made of some physical state. A physical states will play the role of pain just as some tissue will play the role of heart. But they job and the thing that performs the job are distinct from one another. 

## Argument for Functionalism
Functionalists say that for every functionally defined mental state, there is something which plays the role given in the definition. We will say that any entity that plays the role *realizes* it. If functionalism is true, we expect that very different types of entities could realize the same role. Just as both plastic and organic materials can realize the role of a heart, we might then expect that different kinds of entities can realize mental states, e.g., that different types of things could play the role of pain. The very best argument for functionalism is that, in fact, different types of entities can and realize mental states. We will look at one version of this argument that relies heavily on the intuition that a sufficiently complex computer program could realize mental states. Since a computer is made of silicon and our brains are not, if a computer realizes some similar mental states as our brain does, then mental states cannot be identical to any of these physical states. Rather, mental states would be identical to various jobs or functions. 

You may not be surprised that computers may be appealed to when investigating the mind. Whether it is Alexa or Siri, we regularly hear about and increasingly interact with apparently artificially intelligent machines. A word of clarify before we proceed. 'Artificial intelligence' could be understood in different ways when thinking about the mind:  
Weak Artificial Intelligence (WAI):: Computers give us a powerful tool to study the mind. Thinking may be modeled by formal symbol systems, such as computer programs.
Strong Artificial Intelligence (SAI):: Thinking is constituted by the manipulation of formal symbols, such as occurs in a computer program

WAI does not say that the computers really have a mind. It says only that such machines might mimic minds. It may also provide tools for investigating the mind by, for instance, giving us models that approximate the way the mind operates. But, WAI does not say that computers have mental states; it does not state that computers realize mental states. On this view, Siri and Alexa mimic what minds can do, but our iPhones and Amazon devices do not have mental states just by having Siri and Alexa on them mimicing simple conversations.  So, WAI cannot be used to support functionalism. On the other hand, SAI would give strong support for functionalism. If what it is to think just is to manipulate formal symbols, then thinking is a collection of functionally defined state. And if such functions can be performed by both computers and human brains, then functionalism will be vindicated.  

## The Turing Test
The best argument comes from the Cambridge mathematician, Alan Turing. Turing is the parent parent of artificial intelligence and lived a truly remarkable life. During World War II, he worked on Government Code and Cypher School in Bletchley Park and  was key to breaking German naval Enigma. In 1952, he was prosecuted for homosexuality, chemically castrated, and died in 1954 by suicide. In 2013, the British government righted this historic wrong and  gave him a posthumous pardon.

Turing was interested in the question whether machines can think. But he arged that we should rephrase the question as follows: 

-   Can machines do what we as thinking beings can do?

-   Can machine cause an interrogator to wrongly identify it to the same  degree that an ordinary man or woman could?

-   Are there *imaginable digital* computers that would do well in the  game?

> If the interrogator decides wrongly as often when the game is played with the computer as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman, it may be argued that the computer is intelligent.

### Control Case


-   Decision, convincing, and deception via teletype connection.

-   Interrogator asks questions in written natural language.

-   Receives answers in written natural language.

-   Questions can be on any subject imaginable, from mathematics to poetry, from the weather to chess.

### Digital Computer

A Digital Computer is a machine intended to carry out any operation which could be done by a human computer. It has three parts. 

Store:
: a bank of information. It iss like the paper or book that a human computer uses when doing their calculations.

Executive unit:
: carries out the various operations.

Control:
:   is like the rules or instructions for carrying out the calculation. Its job is to ensure that instructions are  obeyed correctly and in the right order.

Notice that we can dramatically increase the size and power of these three parts. So even if we don’t yet have a powerful enough computer that passes the Turing Test, we might build one by increasing the power and size of these parts.

### Clarifying the Turing Test

Distinguish two questions? 

-   Is passing the Turing Test necessary for intelligence?

-   Is passing the Turing Test sufficient for intelligence?

P is necessary for Q =

-   Q cannot be true unless P is true.

-   Q entails P.

P is sufficient for Q =

-   P entails Q.

Examples: 

Having access to a snowboard is necessary for competing in the snowboard contests at the Olympics, but it is not sufficient for doing so.

Winning a medal in a snowboard contest at the Olympics is sufficient for becoming an Olympic medal winner, but it is not necessary for becoming one.

Give an example of conditions that satisfy the following
descriptions: 

-   Necessary, but not sufficient.

-   Sufficient, but not necessary.

-   Necessary and sufficient.

Our Question: 

-   Is passing the Turing Test necessary for intelligence?

-   Is passing the Turing Test sufficient for intelligence?

Here’s why it’s a tricky question:

-   Turing thinks that the question whether machines can think is
    meaningless.

-   He believes that ‘being able to think’ just means ‘being able to pass the test’.

-   Being able to pass the Test is then constitutive of being
    intelligent, i.e., being able to pass is both necessary and sufficient for being intelligent. 


1. For some arbitrary time period, there may be no discernible difference between the linguistic behavior of a person and that of a machine.2. If there is no discernible difference in linguistic behavior between man and machine, then there is no reason to think that there is any underlying difference in the causes of that behavior.3. Thus if we are willing to say that it is intelligent thought that is the cause of the linguistic behavior in the person we should be willing to say the same thing about the machine.


Understanding a sentence is a mental state that plays a functional role, namely, disposes the entity who possess that state to respond in various ways given certain inputs.P2 Given certain inputs, the computer performs in the way specified in the functional definition of understanding.C Thus an appropriately programmed computer is a mind, where a computer is a machine whose operation is defined as an instantiation of a computer program.
