## Self-Knowledge

There are mental states we are aware of and mental states that we are not. How is this possible? This is the problem of self-knowledge, of how we can gain knowledge of our minds. Let us introduce a distinction between first and second order mental states to characterize this self-knowledge. 

![First vs. Second](dog.jpg)


![First vs. Second](second.jpg)

First order mental states: 
: States that are not about the mind, including states that are about the external world, e.g., seeing a tree, hearing music, etc. 

Second order mental states: 
: States that are about first order mental states, e.g., our awareness of our sight of the tree. 


We have special access to our mental states, an access that has two special features. 

1. Privilege: We have special authority over our mental states. Your belief that you are in a certain mental state has more epistemic weight than any third person judgement about your states, e.g., someone else could judge wrongly as to whether you are in pain, but you cannot judge wrongly as to whether you are in pain. 
2. Peculiarity: the manner by which know which mental states you are in differs from the manner by which others know which mental states you are in. They do so by watching your behavior, or listening to your reports, etc. But your knowledge of your own mind is not based on or inferred from evidence about other things. You know what mental states you have and what they are like having these states in some special way. 

Self-reflection relates to our previous topic as follows:  

Claim 1: 
: Access consciousness involves an awareness of one's own mental states--the difference between a conscious and unconscious first order mental state is that we have awareness of the former, but not the latter. 

*Example 1:* You see the road and hear the traffic, but you are not aware of what you see and what you hear when you are talking to your friend. You become aware of what you see and what you hear by becoming aware of your awareness of the car and the traffic. 

*Example 2:* The person in an agitated state does not notice the pain in their side when shot or injured during battle. When they become aware of their pain, they have a second order mental state about their first order mental state. 

Claim 2: 
: A creature is conscious just in case it is capable of being aware of its own first order mental states. 

Our question is this: **How do we become aware of our first-order mental states?**

We will compare and contrast two answers. Both say that we become aware of our mental states by internally scanning those states, by being in a higher order meta-psychological state. But they characterize this meta-psychological state in different ways. 

### Higher Order Perception 

![Internal Perceptions](third.jpg)

HOP: A mental state is a conscious state just in case there is a higher order perception of it--or perception of being in that state. 

Our first theory states that higher order states are very much like perceptual states. To be in these higher order states is akin to seeing, or smelling, or hearing, etc. Just as we see the color,  so too we have an inner perception of our mental states. Such a view is often called an inner sense theory of consciousness as defenders of this view believe that we become aware of our mental states by sensing them, e.g., just as you can look around the room, so too you can 'look' around your mind. 

**In favor of HOP** 

One way of defending HOP is to argue that the awareness of our mental states has the same features as our perceptions of the external world. Analogously, a person might try argue that some music belongs to a particular genre by arguing that the music appropriately resembles that genre. For instance, one might argue Joy Division's music belongs to the genre of post-punk as follows: post-punk music is experimental and anti-corporatist. Joy Divisions's music was experimental and anti-corporatist. Therefore, Joy Division's music was post-punk. 

The argument for HOP has a similar strategy: 1) perception has some features, x, y, z. 2) Awareness of our own mind has features x, y, z. 3) Thus we are aware of our own minds by perceiving them. 

Here are two similarities:  

1. Sense modalities respond differentially to a range of stimuli. We see some things clearly and others not so clearly, e.g., the house in the distance is obscure and hazy, but appears clear and distinct as we approach. Our awareness of our own minds has a similar features. Some mental states appear clear and distinctly. Others are hazy and nondescript, e.g., a nagging pain might have an unclear location, but a sharp pain is easy to locate. 
2. Sense modalities respond directly. Flash a bright light in someone's eyes and there is an immediate perception. Our awareness of our mind also seems to respond directly. Your attention can be brought immediately to the pain in your stubbed toe. 

Since our awareness of our mind is similar to our perceptual capacities in these two ways, one might conclude we are aware of our mental states by perceiving those states. 

**Against HOP**

I argued that Joy Division's music was post-punk by claiming that their music has some features of post-punk music. One way of blocking this argument is to find some other important feature of post-punk that is not shared by Joy Division's music, e.g., post-punk is not melodic, but Joy Division's is. 

A similar strategy is used to show that we are not aware of our mental states by perceiving them, i.e., a strategy that identifies important differences between our awareness of our minds and our perception of the external world:   

+ Mental states do not exemplify a single range of stimuli as sensory modalities do. Hearing is of sound. Vision is of color and shape. Smell is of odors. If we are aware of our mental states by strictly perceiving them, then it seems there should be some specific range of stimuli that this inner perception detects. But it detects a wide range of very disparate mental states, so it doesn't seem like perception at all.  

![What difference?](dog.jpg)

+ Since each perceptual experience has unique content, we expect our higher order perception to have some unique content, content that distinguishes it from first order mental states, in particular, first order perceptual states. But what is this content? 

![What does the perceiving?](organ.jpg)

+ Each sense modality has its own organ. So, higher order perception require its own organ. But there is no such organ. 


+ Ordinary perceptions sometimes malfunction. If we are aware of our mental states by perceiving them, then this perception should also be capable of malfunction. But it seems incoherent that someone could have an accurate first-order perception while having a false higher-order perception.


## Higher Order Thought

Our alternative theory denies that we are aware of our mental states by perceiving them. Rather, the claim that we are aware of our mental states by thinking about them. 

![Inner Thoughts](date.jpg)

1. The awareness of our mental states is conceptual (not perceptual). It is by coming to believe that I am undergoing an experience of red that the experience becomes phenomenally conscious, e.g., I say to myself 'I am experiencing something red' and saying this to myself is what explains why I am aware of the red experience. 
2. Some believe that the higher-order thought accompanies the experience itself â€” it is actually occurring at the same time. Others believe that it does not need to actually occur at the same time, but believe that the first order mental states must be immediately available for us to think about (even if we aren't actually thinking about them). This distinction isn't that important for our purposes. 


## What are thoughts? 
If we are aware of our mental states by thinking about them, but not perceiving them, then we need to characterize the difference between thinking and perceiving. What is the difference between seeing that the tree is green and thinking that the tree is green? The distinction is often made in terms of the contents of these different states; the contents of perception and thoughts are supposedly of different types. 

Thoughts are mental states with conceptual content. But what does that mean? A standard dictionary entry isn't that helpful: 

Conceptual content: 
:  A semantically evaluable, redeployable constituent of thought, invoked to explain properties of intentional phenomena such as productivity and systematicity. Applied to an assortment of phenomena including mental representations, images, words, stereotypes, senses, properties, reasoning abilities, mathematical functions, etc. (Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind)

Nonconceptual content:
: A content, possibly of a non- or sub- doxastic state, whose canonical specification employs concepts which the subject need not possess in order to entertain the content, but rather might, for instance, be canonically specified in terms of abilities and skills the subject possesses, or in terms of significant though nonconceptualized experience. (Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind)


Yikes! These definitions are hard, but the simple idea is that nonconceptual content is content that can be specified without words and concepts available to whoever or whatever is in that state. If insects have mental states, the content of those states might very well be nonconceptual as insects don't have concepts they can use to describe that content. Conceptual content, on the other hand, is content that is characterizable by the words and concepts available to whoever is in that state. In other words, if a butterfly has a state with conceptual content, then the butterfly must have available to it the conceptual resources to characterize that content.  

Conceptual content is also often characterized as propositional and thought characterized as a propositional attitude. A proposition is whatever comes after a 'that' clause, e.g., in the sentence "Socrates said that Meno was at the part last night", the proposition *Meno was at the party last night* is one that Socrates apparently reported. Every proposition is either true or false. The sentence "Yeah for chocolate" is neither true nor false, so it does not express a proposition. "There is chocolate on the plate" is a proposition as this sentence is either true or false (unfortunately false as I write these notes). It's not important what language we use to express a proposition. Different languages can express the very same content. 

There are also different attitudes we can take towards one and the same propositions, e.g., hoping that the cat is on the mat, believing that the cat is on the mat, etc. 

The claim that a thought is a mental state with conceptual content is best understood then as the claim that thoughts are propositional attitudes where the content can be characterized with words that whoever is in that state possesses. The HOT theory say that our awareness of our first mental states---those mental states that are conscious as opposed to unconscious---just  consists in one's having a thought that one is in that very mental state, e.g., my awareness of my red experience just consists in my having the thought "I am having a reading experience", or perhaps "there is a red experience is occurring." Notice that I have to possess these words and concepts in order to have this thought.


**In favor of HOT over HOP** 
1. Thinking is not limited to a single range of stimuli in the way perception is limited. 
2. Thinking is just as immediate as perception. 
3. Thinking does not require an internal sense organ.  
 

**Against HOT** 
1. I am aware of things that I don't have any concepts for and thus cannot have any thoughts about. 

![Colors](green.png)

2. I am aware of my thoughts, e.g., I say to myself 'stop thinking about whether to eat the chocolate you smell and think instead about class tomorrow'. Here I have a second oder thought about chocolate, or rather, I am aware of the sight of chocolate. But I also have a higher order thought about that second order thought, namely, I should stop having that second order thought. Is this a third order thought?
