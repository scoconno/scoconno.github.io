## Introduction
The behaviorist defines a mental state in terms of physiological responses and bodily movements. Pain, on their view, just is a characteristic set of such responses and movements. A radically different view defines mental states in terms of brain states. A brain state is what is *going on* in your brain, more specifically a set of neurons firing in some characteristic pattern. A mental state is a state or condition some mind might be in, e.g., seeing, or thinking, being in pain, etc. So, thoughts, pains, desires, beliefs, etc., are all mental states. The mind-brain identity theory claims that each mental state is identical to some brain state, e.g., pain is identical to some neurons, in particular c-fibres, firing in some particular way. The view is called both the *mind-brain identity theory*, the *psycho-neural identity theory*, and even just *identity theory*,  

How should we understand this view? There is clearly a correlation between mental states and brain states. Hit the brain, change the mind. When we engage in various mental activities, parts of the brain light up. See the video on the main page for this week about the technology being developed to read thoughts from brain activities. The scientists have discovered that when you think of, say, the letter 'A', a particular neuron fires. Since they can detect that neuron, they can infer that your are thinking about the letter. Eventually, these machines will be able to read more complex thoughts by detecting the relevant brain activity associated with those thoughts. There is much to be said about the science behind this view, but, fortunately, we need not focus on those details here. All we need observe is that defenders of the view think that each mental state is identical to some central neural processes, namely, a set of neurons firing in some characteristic way. 

## Mind-Brain Correlations

The mind and brain are clearly interconnected. If you suffer a brain injury, your mental states will change. If you feel fear, your brain too will change. In other words, our mental states correlate with brain states. Putting this a bit more formally:

Mind-Brain Correlation Thesis:
: For each type M of mental event that occurs to an organism o, there exists a brain state of kind B (M’s “neural correlate” or “substrate”) such that M occurs to o at time t if and only if B occurs to o at t. (See Kim, ch.4)

This says that there is a certain *type* of mental state, say, fearing, such that this type of mental state always occurs with at the same time as some *type* of brain state, e.g., some characteristic firing of c-fibres. This correlation between brain states and mental states is strict. Whenever you have a certain type of mental state, you should have a certain type of brain state. Whenever you have a certain kind of brain state, you should have the same kind of mental state. If there is such a correlation, no change in the mind can occur unless there is a change in the brain and *vice versa*. This has the obvious upshot that the mind cannot exist independently of the brain. 

The mere fact that mental and physical states are correlated does not entail that they are identical. Every enclosed figure that has three equal angles is also an enclosed figure with only three sides of equal length, and *vice versa*. But having three equal angles and three equal sides are not identical features even thought they strictly correlate with one another.

So, what explains the mind-brain correlation thesis? Why are mental states and brain states correlated with one another? Different explanations could be offered. Perhaps they are correlated because one is the cause of the other. Or perhaps they are correlated because they have a common cause. The mind-brain identity theory claims that the correlation is explained by the fact that mental states are identical to brain states. 

The claims that mental states are identical to brain states provides a neat and easy explanation for mind brain correlation.  Consider the property of being water and the property of being H20. Whenever something has the property of being water it also has the property of being H20. This correlation, the fact that both properties always co-occur, is explained just by the fact that these are not two properties at all. The property of being water and the property of being H2O are one and the same property. Likewise, the mind-brain identity theory claims that property of being in a certain mental state is identical to the property of being in a certain brain state. There is no surprise that both properties co-occur; they are one and the same property, so of course they co-occur. 


## Arguments for Mind-Brain Identity Theory

### 1. Occam's Razor

Occam's (or Ockham's) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham.  Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born. The principle states:

>  Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.  
+ What can be down with fewer assumption should not be done with more. 


> Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate"
> Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora"
> Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem"

Adopt simplest ontology possible. 

Give examples of conspiracy theories. Choose the theory that has the fewest hypotheses and assumptions. 

So, mind-brain identity might explain correlation by satisfying both examples.


 Isaac Newton stated the rule: "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."

Distinguish two types of simplicity: 

1. Axiom simplicity: the number and conciseness of the theory's basic principles. 
2. Ontological simplicity: the number of kinds of entities postulated by the theory. 



### 2. Causation

An Argument for the Identity Theory
1)  Some conscious states (i.e., mental states)
are the causes of some physical events. For example, my desire causes me to move.
2)  But (according to science) the only things that cause physical events are other physical events.
3)  So, at least some mental states and events must be identical with some physical states and events.


The Argument
•  1) At least some mental events (like choosing to do something) cause physical events.
•  2) But only physical events can cause physical events.
•  3) So, at least some mental events must be physical events.
– i.e., at least some mental states are identical to brain states.



1. Mental events cause physical events.
2. Only physical events can cause physical events.
3. Mental events are physical events, i.e., are identical to brain events.


## Objections to the Mind-Brain Identity Theory

There are many objections to the mind-brain identity theory. Each objection relies on the following set of basic principles: 

Leibniz’ Law:
: If A and B are identical, then whatever properties A has B must have too, and *vice versa*. 

Consider Superman and Clark Kent. Since they are identical, Leibniz' Law tells us that any feature of Clark Kent is also a feature of Superman, and *vice versa*. So, if Clark Kent is wearing classes, so too is Superman. If Superman is flying, so too is Clark Kent. Leibniz Law says simply that numerically distinct things have exactly the same features. 

Leibniz's Law is really helpful for adjudicating questions of identity. Identical things must have the same properties. So, if if A and B have different properties, they cannot be numerically identical. If, for instance, Jekyll and Hyde have different features, they are numerically distinct persons (residing in the same body). 

Leibniz's Law also tells us that if a mental state is identical to a brain state, then the states will have exactly the same properties. Conversely, if they have different properties, they are numerically distinct. In other words, if the mind-brain identity is correct, then Leibniz Law requires the following:

+ If mental state A and brain state B are numerically identical, then A and B have exactly the same properties. 

If, on the other hand, A and B vary in even one property, they A and B are not numerically identical. In order, then, to decide whether mental state are identical to brain states, we should investigate whether properties of the one are always properties of the other. There are at least some properties where this does not seem to hold. 

### Property 1: mental states are such that I can be certain of them

We have direct and private access of our mental states; I can easily and reliably know when I am in a pain state---it feels really sore! I can also easily reliably know when I am having an experience as of a red bicycle--there is an image of a red bicycle before me (even though I might be dreaming, hallucinating, etc.) It seems that our mental states are such that we can be certain that we are in them. But this is not a property of brain states. I have no idea what is happening in my brain right now. Do you? What neurons are firing as you read this page? What is their characteristic pattern? This is something that neuroscientists can now discover with the help of sophisticated machines, but people know their contents of their mind well before they knew anything about brains or neurons. So, the argument against the mind-brain identity theory is this: 

1. I can be certain of my mental states (e.g., pain).
2. I cannot be certain of my brain states.
3. Therefore, mental states have properties (of being such that I can be certain of them) that brain states lack.
4. Therefore, mental states are not identical to brain states.

The argument appears straightforward, but raises a very difficult question about Leibniz's Law: does it apply to *intensional* properties like 'belief', 'knowledge', etc. Consider Lois Lane before she learns that Superman and Clark Kent are one and the same person. Lois Lane believes that Superman saves the city. So, Superman has the property of being believed by Lois Lane to have saved the city. Does Clark Kent have that property? If he is identical to Superman, then he should also have that property. But Lois Lane doesn't think that Clark Kent saved the city!

So, Leibniz Law has a problem. If it includes properties of being believed to be a certain way, then it is obviously false. But the Law shouldn't include those properties; the beliefs that others have about something shouldn't affect what that thing is or is not identical to. So, perhaps Leibniz's Law should be formulated as stating that if A and B are identical, then A and B have the same intrinsic properties, where intrinsic properties do not involve beliefs about it. 

When Leibniz's Law is reformulated in this way, our first argument against the mind-brain identity theory falls flat: the fact that I know or believe different things about mental states and brain states is irrelevant to questions about their identity. 


### Property 2: having a color
Some other arguments against the mind-brain identity theory are harder to escape. Stare at a bright green piece of paper for thirty seconds and then look up towards a blank, white wall. You will likely experience a green after-image; there will be a greenish hue to the wall that fades after a moment. It seems that our mental states have various color after-images. Can brain states have these same colors? Neurons do have colors, but those colors do not vary by whatever experience they correlate with. The neuron has the same color regardless of whether I am having a greed, red, or purple after image. So, here is our next argument against the mind-brain identity theory:  

1. I am experiencing a green after-image.
2. No brain states are green.
3. Therefore, my after-image is not identical to any brain state. 

If my after-image was identical to a brain state, then the properties of the after-image must also be properties of the brain state. One property of the after-image is that it is green. But this is not a property of the brain state correlated with that image! 

This argument assumes that the after-image is literally green and I will leave you to decide whether you think that it is true. If it is not literally green, then the argument fails. If it is literally green, then the argument succeeds. 

### Propert 3--Multiple Realizability 

The multiple realizability thesis states that a single mental kind (property, state, event) can be realized by many distinct physical kinds (property, state, event). Sharks feel pain, but sharks do not have c-fibres. Their brains are just very different to humans. An alien made of different stuff than we are might still experience pain. A very sophisticated robot might one day experience pain. This poses a problem for the mind-brain identity theory:

1. Pain has the property of being correlated with c-fibres firing in humans. 
2. Pain does not have the property of being correlated with c-fibres firing in sharks. 
3. Pain is not identical to c-fibres firing. 

Premise 2 could be replaced with examples of plants feeling pain, non-carbon based life-form feeling pain, synthetic creatures (robots) feeling pain, etc. The point is that there are things that feel pain and their pain is not correlated with the kind of brain states that are correlated with our pain. An identity theory might respond here and claim that such things do not feel pain, or that their *pain* is not the same type of mental state that we call *pain*. But I will leave you to decide how plausible is such a strategy.
