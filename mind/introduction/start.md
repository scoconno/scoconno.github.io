## Who I am

Welcome! My name is Dr. Scott O'Connor, and I'll be your instructor for this course. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I received a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are ancient philosophy and metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website. 

While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O'Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No 'hey', 'yo', 'what's up', smiley face, etc. See [contact](/contact) for further information.


## Textbook
Please find details about the textbook on the syllabus. I will photocopy some readings for weeks 1 and 2, but you will need the textbook from week 3 onwards. The book is available online and in the campus bookstore. The textbook I chose is a compromise between quality and price. Some others are easier, but much more expensive. This means that some of the chapters in this textbook are less accessible than I would like. I will remedy this by providing supplemental reading and videos on the website. 

## Late work and extra credit
Students sometimes ask to submit work late or ask for a make-up opportunity. I used to receive many of these requests and found it difficult to adjudicate them. I also want to treat my students equally and am frustrated by students who expect special treatment. 

But, students do get sick. Life does get in the way. So, here is what I do instead of accepting late work and offering extra credit: I assign more essays and quizzes than are needed to complete the course. If you are still unable to complete the required number of assignments due to illness, personal problems, etc, then you should withdraw from the course. NJCU also offers medical withdrawals for students who miss the ordinary withdrawal dates. So, moral of the story: I will teach you the material and help you complete the assignments, but I will not entertain requests for extra credit or accept late work. Please don't ask. 


## Technical Help

All Blackboard activity is recorded. I see when you log on, what you click, and how long you stay on the pages you click. Blackboard outages are rare and are automatically reported to me. If you encounter technical difficulties, the most likely source will be a difficulty with your browser or computer. Do take a moment to ensure your browser is up to date. If you are uncertain how to use Blackboard or have some technical difficulty, please consult NJCU's online learning resources here: [http://newlearning.njcu.edu/dl/enrolled.htm](http://newlearning.njcu.edu/dl/enrolled.htm)

I occasionally have students report that their computer crashes one minute before an assignment is due. My response is always the same: it is your responsibility to ensure that you are using a reliable computer on a stable internet connection. If your computer crashed one minute before an assignment is due, I encourage you to reflect on whether leaving the assignment to the last minute was a responsible strategy. 


## Next Steps 

1. Read the syllabus carefully. Course policies vary by professors, sometimes significantly. I don't allow make-ups, but other professors do. You need to understand the policies that govern this course and understand what is required of you.  

2. Read ch.1 of the textbook, on this week's list of materials, as well as my introduction to the course under 'notes'. 

3. There are no assignments in this first week. Familiarize with the website and materials. Contact me if you have questions about the policies. And get ready to start with the
