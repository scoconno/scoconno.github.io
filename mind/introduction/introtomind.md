## Introduction

Minds are curious sorts of thing. We readily distinguish those things that have them from those that do not. Pet owners regularly gush over their little darlings, claiming that little Fido is *excited* when outside, or furry Penny, my cat, *dislikes* beings picked up. In making these claims, pet owners are attributing to mentality to animals; they assume their pets have desires, emotions, experience pleasure and pain, etc. It seem likely that non-human creatures do experience things like pain and pleasure, but it is difficult to decide which do and do not.  One reason this is so is that we attribute mentality to creatures based on their behavior, but entities without minds can mimic such behavior. For instance, many think that cats and dogs enjoy a mental life because they seem to perceive their environment and act accordingly. But if this is reliable evidence that animals have minds, then it shows us that automatic cars, robotic vacuum cleaners, and oysters have minds. For these things too perceive their surroundings and behave accordingly. 

Should we be so confident that our pets have minds? Perhaps they merely mimic our behavior and more akin to a robotic car than a young child. Here you might reply that the robot car might too have a mind. Perhaps an artificially intelligent creature could be sufficiently complex to enjoy mentality too. 

In order to answer questions like these, we need to know what it is to have a mind, which is the guiding question of this course. 

## What is the philosophy of mind? 

Philosophers have no special claim to the study of the mind. Many disciplines ask what it is to have a mind and claim to make progress in answering that question, e.g., psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience. What does philosophy have to offer in addition to these disciplines? It might be surprising that the philosopher has anything to offer: if you wanted to learn about cells, you would ask the cell biologist, not the philosopher. 

One think philosophers do is identify and clarify which questions must be answered if we are to fully understand the nature of mind. A biological cell is a target that we can all identify. The questions we must ask about this target are relevantly clear. Not so with the mind. Disciplines do not yet even agree on which questions are the relevant questions. Should we be focused merely on the way brain processes information? Must we also understand how a person represent their environment to themselves? What exactly are those questions that must be asked about the mind? 

A philosopher here responds that before we can answer whether something has a mind, we need to identify the marks of mentality. Before we can know, for instance, whether a scientist has offered a full and exhaustive account of consciousness, we need to identify the marks of consciousness, something we will focus on at the end of this semester.

A good place to start is by noticing the vast variety of mental phenomena, or 'mental state'. We will often talk about mental states in this class. They are roughly states of the mind as opposed to states of the body, e.g., the thought of ice-cream on a hot day is a mental state, a state you are in when thinking about ice-cream. The acid in your stomach digesting that stomach is a state of your body and not your mind. 

First, there are a large group of mental states that we might call phenomenal or qualitative states. Amongst these are included  1) sensations like pains, itches, tickles, etc. 2) Perceptions, mental states we are in when we have an experience, or apparent experience, of the external world whether it be a sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. So, for instance, when you see the ice-cream cone, the seeing is one mental state, when you taste the ice-cream, the tasting is a different mental state, when you feel the ice-cream running down your fingers, the feeling is yet another mental state, etc. And when dog licks your hand, the tickle the dog causes is yet another mental state. Some of these mental states, especially perceptions, seem primarily to give us information about the world, something other than your body. Others, the sensations, seem primarily to give us informaiton about our body. Despite all these differences, though, all these mental states seem similar in one important respect, each has its own distinctive feel that is essential to it. There is a feel to pain that makes pain the mental state it is. There is a different feel to seeing green that make  it the particular mental state it is. It will be one of our main tasks in this course to get clearer on what these 'feels' are and to understand how exactly we have access to them. 

A second group of mental states are called 'propositional attitudes'. This is a technical phrase and we'll be learning many in this course, though I will use as few as possible. Propositional attitutes correspond roughly to the different types of thoughts that we can have. Contemplating the nature of ice-cream and hoping for ice-cream are different types of thoughts and both are very different from tasting or seeing the ice-cream. 'Propositional attitudes' or different attitudes, or mental states, we can be in towards a proposition, where a proposition is just any that-clauses. For example, in teh sentence 'President Barack Obama hopes that Congress will retain the Affordable Care Act', *Congress will retain the Affordable Care Act* is a proposition that the Obama has an attitude towards, i.e., he hopes that it turns out true. But we could have other attituese towards the same proposition, e.g., we could believe that the proposition is true, we could fear the proposition is true, etc. The idea, then, is that whenever we have a thought, there is some proposition we are entertaininng and some attitude we have towards that proposition. The propositions, in other words, are the content of the thoughts. These states are also called â€œintentional", which means that they are about or directed upon objects that may or may not exist. 

Thoughts and feelings are obviously very different. Thinking about the number 2 is different from feeling itchy during a geometry class. Itches don't seem to be attitudes towards propositions; no proposition is the content of the itch. Thinking about the number seems to have no raw feel to it whatsoever. But a third group of mental states seem to have both content and feels to them, i.e., emotions. They include anger, joy, sadness, depression, elation, pride, embarrassment, remorse, regret, shame, ect. Emotions are often attributed to persons with a that-clause, e.g., 'President Obama is depressed that Congress is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act', 'Paul Ryan is proud that Congress is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act', etc.  But emotions are more than mere thoughts. There are also various feelings we associate with many emotions. Being depressed and proud could have the same content, but they feel very different. 

I have here listed three different types of mental states. But in virtue of what common property are should all these common states be called "mental"? Why should a thought and an ithch be called mental but your glucose and cholestoral levels be called physical? We might, for instance, think that intentionality is the mark of the mental, that all mental states represent or are directed to things in the world. If that's true, then are sensations also intention? If so, what do they represent? If not, then there must be some other featre of all these states that make them mental as opposed to non-mental. And it is to this question that philosophers have much to say. 



## Our Topics
We will focus on three topics: 

Personal-Identity



Mind-body problem: the mind and brain are intimately connected. Every mental change correlates with some physical change in the brain. Or, as philosophers like to say, mental states supervene on brain states, where this just means that whenever our mental states change, so too do our brain states. But how can explain this correlation? Our brains state are neural states, states in which various neurons are firing. Neurons, in tunr, are ultiamtely composed of the most fundamental bits of matter. So, when we enjoy listening to a piece of music, this enjoyment correlates with some sequence of neural firing. The enjoyment and nueral firing seem very different; enjoyments don't seem to be made up of bits of matter, for instance. So, how can they be so intimately connected? This is called the mind-body problem and is the problem that has received most attention, both historically and in comtemporary investigations of the mind in psycholgoy, neuroscience, cognitive science, etc.
