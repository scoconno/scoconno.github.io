## Introduction

Minds are curious sorts of thing. We readily distinguish those things that have them from those that do not. Pet owners regularly gush over their little darlings, claiming that little Fido is *excited* when outside, or furry Penny, my cat, *dislikes* beings picked up. In making these claims, pet owners are attributing to mentality to animals; they assume their pets have desires, emotions, experience pleasure and pain, etc. It seem likely that non-human creatures do experience things like pain and pleasure, but it is difficult to decide which do and do not.  One reason this is so is that we attribute mentality to creatures based on their behavior, but entities without minds can mimic such behavior. For instance, many think that cats and dogs enjoy a mental life because they seem to perceive their environment and act accordingly. But if this is reliable evidence that animals have minds, then it shows us that automatic cars, robotic vacuum cleaners, and oysters have minds. For these things too perceive their surroundings and behave accordingly. 

Should we be so confident that our pets have minds? Perhaps they merely mimic our behavior and more akin to a robotic car than a young child. Here you might reply that the robot car might too have a mind. Perhaps an artificially intelligent creature could be sufficiently complex to enjoy mentality too. 

In order to answer questions like these, we need to know what it is to have a mind, which is the guiding question of this course. 

## What is the philosophy of mind? 

Philosophers have no special claim to the study of the mind. Many disciplines ask what it is to have a mind and claim to make progress in answering that question, e.g., psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience. What does philosophy have to offer in addition to these disciplines? It might be surprising that the philosopher has anything to offer: if you wanted to learn about cells, you would ask the cell biologist, not the philosopher. But note that a cell is a target that we can agree upon; it is something that can be seen under a microscope and it is relatively clear what questions need to be answered in order to understand what it is. The mind is not like this. There is no agreement over what questions we should ask about the mind or even how we should go about answering them.Should we be focused merely on the way brain processes information? Must we also understand how a person represent their environment to themselves? What exactly are those questions that must be asked about the mind? 

It is here that philosophy plays one role. Philosopher identify and clarify which questions must be answered if we are to fully understand the nature of mind. They first seek to identify the marks of mentality. Before we can know, for instance, whether a scientist has offered a full and exhaustive account of consciousness, we need to identify the marks of consciousness, something we will focus on at the end of this semester.

So, what are the marks of the mental? A good place to start is by noticing that there are a vast variety of mental phenomena, or 'mental states'. 'Mental state' is a phrase you will hear a lot about in this class. Roughly, you should think of them as states of the mind as opposed to states of the body. For instance, the thought of ice-cream on a hot day is a mental state, a state you are in when thinking about ice-cream. The acid in your stomach digesting that stomach is a state of your body. It is not a mental state, a state of your mind. All of your beliefs, desires, emotions, thoughts, etc. are mental states; they are states that your mind is in. 

There are various distinctions we can draw amongst these mental states. First, there are a large group of mental states that we might call phenomenal or qualitative states. Amongst these are included  1) sensations like pains, itches, tickles, etc., and 2) perceptions, smell, taste, etc. So, when you feel an itch, that itch is a mental state, a state of your mind. When you see an ice-cream cone, that seeing is one mental state. When you taste the ice-cream, that tasting is a different mental state. When you feel the ice-cream running down your fingers, that feeling is yet another mental state, etc. Perceptions and sensations have some interesting differences. Perception primarily serves to provide information about the world, about something other than our body (thought it can provide information about our body too). Sensations, on the other hand, seem primarily to give us information about our body. Despite all these differences, though, all these mental states seem similar in one important respect, each has its own distinctive feel that is essential to it. There is a feel to pain that makes pain the mental state it is. There is a different feel to seeing green that make  it the particular mental state it is. It will be one of our main tasks in this course to get clearer on what these 'feels' are and to understand how exactly we have access to them. 

A second group of mental states are called 'propositional attitudes'. This is a technical phrase, one of the many phrases that we'll be learning in this course, though I will use as few as possible. Propositional attitudes correspond roughly to the different types of thoughts that we can have. Contemplating the nature of ice-cream and hoping for ice-cream are different thoughts. And while they are different from one another, they seem more similar than tasting something or seeing something. 

A propositional attitude is an attitude we can be in towards a proposition, where a proposition is just any that-clause. For example, in th sentence 'President Barack Obama hopes that Congress will retain the Affordable Care Act', *Congress will retain the Affordable Care Act* is a proposition that President Obama has an attitude towards, i.e., he hopes that it turns out true. But we could have other attitudese towards the same proposition, e.g., we could believe that the proposition is true, we could fear the proposition is true, etc. The idea, then, is that whenever we have a thought, there is some proposition that we have some attitude towards. The propositions, in other words, are the content of the thoughts. These states are also called *intentional*, which means that they are about or directed upon objects that may or may not exist. 

Thoughts and feelings are obviously very different. Thinking about the number 2 is different from feeling itchy during a geometry class. Itches don't seem to be attitudes towards propositions; what proposition is the content of an itch?  Thinking about the number also seems to have no raw feel associated with it. A third group of mental states seem to have both content and feels to them, i.e., emotions. They include anger, joy, sadness, depression, elation, pride, embarrassment, remorse, regret, shame, ect. Emotions are often attributed to persons with a that-clause, e.g., 'President Obama is depressed that Congress is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act', 'Paul Ryan is proud that Congress is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act', etc.  But emotions are more than mere thoughts. There are also various feelings we associate with many emotions. Being depressed and proud could have the same content, but they feel very different. 

## Our Topics

I have here listed three different types of mental states. Do animals have all three types? Or do they have some, but not others? Perhaps dogs can see the world and experience pain, but do not think or feel anger. If so, would they still have a mind? 

This is one of the questions that philosophers ask; what kind of mental states must a creature have to have a mind? 

But in virtue of what common property are should all these common states be called "mental"? Why should a thought and an itch be called mental but your glucose and cholestoral levels be called physical? We might, for instance, think that intentionality is the mark of the mental, that all mental states represent or are directed to things in the world. If that's true, then are sensations also intention? If so, what do they represent? If not, then there must be some other featre of all these states that make them mental as opposed to non-mental. And it is to this question that philosophers have much to say. 



## Our Topics
We will focus on three topics: 

Personal-Identity



Mind-body problem: the mind and brain are intimately connected. Every mental change correlates with some physical change in the brain. Or, as philosophers like to say, mental states supervene on brain states, where this just means that whenever our mental states change, so too do our brain states. But how can explain this correlation? Our brains state are neural states, states in which various neurons are firing. Neurons, in tunr, are ultiamtely composed of the most fundamental bits of matter. So, when we enjoy listening to a piece of music, this enjoyment correlates with some sequence of neural firing. The enjoyment and nueral firing seem very different; enjoyments don't seem to be made up of bits of matter, for instance. So, how can they be so intimately connected? This is called the mind-body problem and is the problem that has received most attention, both historically and in comtemporary investigations of the mind in psycholgoy, neuroscience, cognitive science, etc.
