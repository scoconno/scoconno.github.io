## Introduction

 There are many responses to the Jackson’s Knowledge Argument. Jim Pryor groups the replies by their answers to these questions. 

 1. When Mary comes out of the room and first sees something red, does she genuinely acquire some new piece of knowledge, i.e., knowledge of some new fact?   
 2. If she does acquire some new piece of knowledge, is what she comes to know some new fact about our experiences, of which she was previously ignorant? Or is what she comes to know some old fact, now known in a new way? (http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/courses/mind/notes/mary-con.html)

I will discuss three such responses below. The first two will deny that Mary learns any new information about leaving the room. The second accepts

## Objection 1: Mary can imagine red before her release

After Mary learns all the physical facts about our experience of red, Jackson claims that she still does not know what it is like to experience red. Our first objection denies this. It claims that Mary can imagine red by learning all the physical facts about experiencing red. So even before she leaves the room, she knows what it is like to experience red by imagining what red looks like. 

How should we assess this response? We can imagine things that we have not seen in person by studying information about that thing. Suppose an architect is provided the plans for a building that was constructed in, say, Alexandria, Egypt. Suppose also that this architect has never personally seen the building. A good architect can imagine what the building looks like just by studying the plans. The knowledge they gain from the plans allows them to imagine what the building looks like, and so come to know what the building looks like. 

Might we similarly be able to imagine red without seeing red just by studing what happens in a persons' brain when they see red? This seems unlikely. If I can imagine red by learning all the physical facts about the experience of red, then complete physical knowledge necessarily involves the capacity to imagine red. In other words, it would be impossible to have complete physical knowledge of the experience of red and not have the ability to imagine red. Similarly, it would be impossible to have complete knowledge of the building's design without being able to imagine what it looks like. 

But this seems false when it comes to our experience of red. A completely blind scientist who studies color vision by reading the results from her machines in braille does not have the ability to imagine red. So, if our blind scientist is unable to imagine red by knowing all the physical facts, why should Mary have the ability to imagine red by just knowing all the physical facts about the experience of red? 

It shouldn't be surprising that this objection to the Knowledge Argument fails. No one can know what it is like to see red without actually ever having seen something red.  

## Mary gains ability knowledge##

The Knowledge Argument assumes that Mary learns some new fact after she leaves the room, i.e., she learns some fact about the experience of red. But some have claimed that there is a distinction between learning a fact and learning how to do something, and that Mary learns the latter but not the former, i.e., the claim that knowledge that and knowledge how are different types of knowledge. David Lewis writes: 

> The Ability Hypothesis says that knowing what an experience is like just is the possession of these abilities to remember, imagine, and recognize. … It isn't knowing-that. It's knowing-how. (Lewis 1990, 516)

Lewis concedes that "knowing what an experience is like" requires having the experience. He also agrees that knowing all the physical facts about the experience of red will not let you know what it is like to have the experience.  But Lewis denies that coming to "know what an experience is like" is a matter of learning new facts. He thinks that Jackson’s argument proves that we learn no new information at all when we have a new experience.  Rather, you have learned some new abilities. 

Consider other examples of knowing-how. I know how to ride a bicycle. I know how to sail a boat. I know how to play guitar. This knowledge seems different from the propositional knowledge I have about, say geometry, e.g., that a line is the shortest distance between two points. Even though I know how to sail a boat, I’m unsure I can formulate this knowledge in terms of a series of propositions that I know. I just move the tiller a certain way when I need to. I just trim the sail, alter course, tac and jibe when I need to. 

Similarly, perhaps all Mary gains when she leaves the room is some new abilities. What are these abilities? 

	1.	the ability to remember experiencing red
	2.	the ability to imagine or visualize the color red
	3.	the ability to recognize objects as red by sight
	4.	the ability to recognize experiences of red (as experiences of that sort, which you've had before)

### Response 1

But, this objections has problems. Note first that these abilities seem neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to have an experience of red. For instance, I might have an experience of F, know what it is like to have an experience of F, but be unable to ever imagine or visualize F. I certainly have experiences that I can’t recreate in my mind’s eye, e.g., smell. It also seems possible to have the ability to imagine some property Q without knowing what it is like to experience Q. Suppose, for instance, you are very good at imagining colors, but have yet the opportunity to imagine each color—you just haven’t got round to it yet. Many of us have abilities that we haven’t yet exercised, e.g., I’m pretty sure I can play the Irish National Anthem on the guitar, but I haven’t ever sat down and done it.  

### Response 2


Lewis’ response requires that all Mary learns are abilities. If she learns any new facts, then his response fails. In other words, Jackson can agree that Mary learns new abilities. But his point is that she also learns some new facts. But Mary does learn new fact. She is investigating the experiences of others. The question is whether she learns anything new about other peoples’ experiences of red when she has a red experience herself. Doesn’t she learn some new fact when she learns that others have red experiences? 



### Response 3

There is a difference between having an ability and knowing what it is like to exercise that ability. Mike Thau puts it as follows:

> Leon has seen red, like the rest of us, but at the age of 20 he shuts himself up in the black and white room for 30 years. Leon retains the ability to visualize red, to remember what experiences of red are like, and so on. But we can suppose that, while he's in the room, he never exercises these abilities. He hasn't visualized red or had any memories of seeing red for all that time. At the age of 50, Leon comes out of the room again, and looks at a ripe tomato. He says, "I'd forgotten what it's like to see red! Now I know again.” Mike Thau

Similarly, I know how to trim a sail. But I haven’t done it in ages. When I sail again, I will trim the sail and say, ‘wow, I had forgotten what it is like to trim a sail.’ Lewis claims that Mary learns new abilities when she sees red. But Mary seems to acquire knowledge of what it is like to exercise those abilities. So it’s unclear that acquiring abilities is the same as learning what it is like to exercise them. The point here is that Lewis wants to describe what happens when Mary leaves the room as her learning new abilities. But this doesn’t fully capture what is happening. 
 


 
 Is the objection even right to think that knowing what it is like to see red involves knowing how to imagine red? Suppose there is someone who (for whatever reason) has no ability to imagine seeing red. Now suppose this person looks attentively at something red. While they look at red, they know what is it like to see red. And yet they cannot imagine seeing red. This shows that the ability to imagine is not necessary for knowing what it is like to see red. Now suppose someone else has the most amazing ability to imagine seeing colours. They are told that there is a shade of red, e.g. burgundy, that is between plum red and tomato red. They are now able to imagine burgundy, but as long as they don’t actually imagine burgundy, they still don’t know what it is like to see burgundy. This shows that the ability to imagine a colour is not sufficient to know what it is like to see it. (We can make similar arguments for recognizing colours.)  If the ability to imagine seeing red is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see red, then when Mary comes to know what it is like to see red, she learns more than simply knowing how to imagine seeing red. The objection fails to show that Mary does not learn a new fact. It fails to show that the knowledge argument is mistaken.  


necessary and sufficient issues


## New ways of knowing the same fact

Assume that there was some knowledge that Mary lacked before leaving the room. Assume that Mary acquires new knowledge upon leaving the room. Does Mary thereby come to acquire knowledge of some new fact? 

Some think you can come to learn the same fact in different ways. Consider these two sentences: 

1. ‘Batman saved Gotham City from the Joker’
2. ‘Bruce Wayne saved Gotham City from the Joker’

These two sentences seem to express the same fact, but describe that fact in two different ways. Suppose that you don’t know on Monday that Batman and Bruce Wayne are the same person. On Monday, you would then know the first sentence without knowing the second. Suppose you learn on Tuesday that Bruce Wayne is Batman. You would then know that sentence 2 is true. But you haven’t learned some new fact by learning that 2 is true. You have learned the same fact in some new way.  

So perhaps Mary doesn’t learn any new facts about the experience of red when she leaves the room. Perhaps she comes to know an old fact in some different way.

It’s difficult to distinguish between learning some old fact in a new way and learning some brand new fact. Consider the Batman case again. When you think about Batman, you think about a caped superhero with a dark voice, no superpowers, a utility belt, and access to advanced technology. Your concept of Batman includes these various features that you associated with him. Your concept of Bruce Wayne is different. When you think about Bruce, you think about a billionaire, orphaned young when his parents were killed, someone cared for by a butler, someone relatively carefree and irresponsible. When you learn that one person is both Bruce Wayne and Batman, you realize that one person has all the various features you had associated with both, e.g., he is both a caped superhero and an orphan. You have learned that you had two concepts all along about the same person.

Might this explain what Mary learns when she leaves the room? Let us say that P is the property of being an experience of red. Before leaving the room, Mary might have one concept for P. Namely, she has a physical concept for P, a concept which has associated with it all the various physical facts she has learned in her studies. So Mary already knows that an experience of red has property P, but she conceptualizes P as a purely physical property. When Mary leaves the room, perhaps she does not learn some new fact, namely, that the experience of red has some property distinct from P. Perhaps all she learns is a new concept for P. If so, she does not learn a new fact about the experience of P, she only learns a new way of conceptualizing that fact. 

This seems unrealistic. Mary doesn’t know any of the various qualitative properties of a red experience before leaving the room. That is, she doesn’t have some haha moment and say to herself, ‘I knew about some various qualitative properties and I knew all the physical facts about some experience P, but it’s only now that I know that the experience of P has these various qualitative properties.’ Mary has no idea what it’s like to experience color. Equivalently, if I don’t know anything at all about Bruce Way, it’s hard to say that I only come to learn some old fact in a new way when I learn that Batman saved Gotham city. 


Suppose I know that there is water in the glass. Is that the same as knowing that there is H2O in the glass? No – because someone may know one of these truths without knowing the other. Someone can have the concept of ‘water’ without having the concept of ‘H2O’. Or again, someone may have both concepts, but not know that water and H2O are the same thing. So we can say that to know that there is water in the glass and to know that there is H2O in the glass is to know two different facts. In this sense of ‘fact’, we count facts in terms of concepts.  However, in another sense of ‘fact’, the fact that there is water in the glass just is the fact that there is H2O in the glass. Both of these claims are made true by just one state of affairs in the world. In this sense of ‘fact’, we count facts in terms of how the world is, not how we think about it.  We can now apply this to the knowledge argument. Before leaving the room, Mary has a concept of red in physical terms – wavelengths of light, neurons firing, and so on. Call this the ‘physical’ or again a ‘theoretical’ concept of red. We can contrast this with a ‘phenomenal’ concept of red. A phenomenal concept of something is the concept by which you recognize something when you experience or perceive it. So we gain the phenomenal concept of red by seeing red.  When Mary comes out the room and sees red, she acquires the phenomenal concept of red for the first time. She is now able to think about red in a new way, in terms of what it is like to see red. She couldn’t know what it is like to see red before because she didn’t have the phenomenal concept. But, we can claim, the phenomenal concept of red is a concept of the same thing that her physical concept is a concept of – they are two different concepts of a physical property 
of the brain (like water and H2O are two concepts of the same physical substance). Mary gains knowledge of a new fact in one sense (because she gains a new concept) but not in the other sense (since she already knew about the property).  Let us accept that the knowledge argument shows that there are different ways of thinking about physical things, some of which depend on experiencing, rather than describing. To know what it is like to see red, you need to have the phenomenal concept of red, and this you can only gain from experience. So Mary gains knowledge of a new fact, in the sense of fact that relates to concepts.  However, and this is the objection, physicalism and property dualism are claims about what exists. They are claims about properties, not about concepts. The knowledge argument does not show that Mary gains knowledge of a new property. It doesn’t show that Mary gains knowledge of a new fact in the sense of learning about something in the world she didn’t know about before. It doesn’t show that what it is like to see red cannot be a physical property. So the argument fails to show that there are any non-physical properties. So it fails to show that physicalism is false.
