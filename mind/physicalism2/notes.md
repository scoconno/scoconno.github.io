## Introduction

 There are many responses to the Jackson’s Knowledge Argument. These responses can be characterized by their answers to the following questions. 

 1. When Mary comes out of the room and first sees something red, does she acquire new knowledge? 
 2. If she does acquire new knowledge, is what she comes to know some new fact about our experiences, of which she was previously ignorant? 

I will discuss three such responses below. The first denies that Mary learns anything new upon leaving the room. The second and third accept that she learns something new, but they deny that this new knowledge is knowledge of any facts about the experience of red. The second claims she learns a new ability. The third claims she learns a new way to present a fact that she had already knowledge about. The fourt, of course, presents the view of those who accept the conclusion of the Knowledge Argument. Here is a table to remind you of our various views.


|	 			|Q1  	|Q2	|
|:--------:			|:-----:|:----: |
| Imagination Response		| No	|   	|
| Ability Hypothesis Response	| Yes	| No    |
| Old Fact New Way Response	| Yes	| No    |
| Jackson			| Yes	| Yes  	|



## Objection 1: Mary can imagine red before her release

After Mary learns all the physical facts about our experience of red, Jackson claims that she still does not know what it is like to experience red. Our first objection denies this. It claims that Mary can imagine red by learning all the physical facts about experiencing red. So even before she leaves the room, she knows what it is like to experience red by imagining what red looks like. 

How should we assess this response? We can imagine things that we have not seen in person by studying information about that thing. Suppose an architect is provided the plans for a building that was constructed in, say, Alexandria, Egypt. Suppose also that this architect has never personally seen the building. A good architect can imagine what the building looks like just by studying the plans. The knowledge they gain from the plans allows them to imagine what the building looks like, and so come to know what the building looks like. 

Might we similarly be able to imagine red without seeing red just by studing what happens in a persons' brain when they see red? This seems unlikely. If I can imagine red by learning all the physical facts about the experience of red, then complete physical knowledge necessarily involves the capacity to imagine red. In other words, it would be impossible to have complete physical knowledge of the experience of red and not have the ability to imagine red. Similarly, it would be impossible to have complete knowledge of the building's design without being able to imagine what it looks like. 

But this seems false when it comes to our experience of red. A completely blind scientist who studies color vision by reading the results from her machines in braille does not have the ability to imagine red. So, if our blind scientist is unable to imagine red by knowing all the physical facts, why should Mary have the ability to imagine red by just knowing all the physical facts about the experience of red? 

It shouldn't be surprising that this objection to the Knowledge Argument fails. It is difficult to understand how anyone can know what it is like to see red without actually ever having seen something red.  

## Mary gains ability knowledge

The Knowledge Argument assumes that Mary learns some new fact after she leaves the room, i.e., she learns some fact about the experience of red. But some have claimed that the new knowledge Mary gains is not knowledge of any fact but a different kind of knowledge altogether. The view is motivated by distinguishing between learning a fact and learning how to do something, between *factualy knowledge* and *ability knowledge*. Physicalism is not undermined if Mary only acquires ability knowledge upon leaving the room. David Lewis writes: 

> The Ability Hypothesis says that knowing what an experience is like just is the possession of these abilities to remember, imagine, and recognize. … It isn't knowing-that. It's knowing-how. (Lewis 1990, 516)

Lewis concedes that "knowing what an experience is like" requires having the experience. He also agrees that knowing all the physical facts about the experience of red will not let you know what it is like to have the experience.  But Lewis denies that coming to "know what an experience is like" is a matter of learning new facts. He thinks that Jackson’s argument proves that we learn no new information at all when we have a new experience.  Rather, we learn some new abilities. 

Consider other examples of knowing-how, or ablity knowledge. I know how to ride a bicycle. I know how to sail a boat. I know how to play guitar. This knowledge seems different from the propositional knowledge I have about, say geometry, e.g., that a line is the shortest distance between two points. Even though I know how to sail a boat, I’m unsure I can formulate this knowledge in terms of a series of propositions that I know. I just move the tiller a certain way when I need to. I just trim the sail, alter course, tac and jibe when I need to. So, this knowledge does seem different from knowledge of any facts. For instance, if a person read everything there was to know about riding a bike, they wouldn't know how to ride a bike until they practiced. 

Similarly, perhaps all Mary gains when she leaves the room is some new abilities. What are these abilities? 

1.	the ability to remember experiencing red
2.	the ability to imagine or visualize the color red
3.	the ability to recognize objects as red by sight
4.	the ability to recognize experiences of red (as experiences of that sort, which you've had before)

This respond to Knowledge Argument has many problems. I will survey three.

### Problem 1

These abilities seem neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to have an experience of red. Consider
the ability to imagine something. I have eaten truffles, so I know what truffles taste and smell like. But I find it difficult to imagine tastes and smells. Images are easy. But tastes are smells are really hard. So, even though I know what it is like to have an experience of a truffle, I am unable to ever imagine the experience. If Lewis' reply was correct, then the fact that I know what a truffle tastes like means I should also have to ability to imagine that taste. But, I dont! So, this ability is not necessary for knowing what various experiences are like. 

In addition, it also seems possible to have the ability to imagine some property Q without knowing what it is like to experience Q. Suppose, for instance, you are very good at imagining colors, but have yet the opportunity to imagine each color—you just haven’t got round to it yet. Many of us have abilities that we haven’t yet exercised, e.g., I’m pretty sure I can play the Irish National Anthem on the guitar, but I haven’t ever sat down and done it. So, it seems that these abilities are not sufficient for knowledge of an eperience--I could imagine what it is like to experience red without knowing what a red object looks like.   

### Problem 2

Lewis’ response requires that all Mary learns are abilities. If she learns any new facts, then his response fails. In other words, Jackson can agree that Mary learns new abilities. But his point is that she also learns some new facts. Has Lewis proved that Mary learns no new fact whatsoever?

Recall that Mary is investigating the experiences of others. She learns every physical fact about John's experience of red. So, our question is whether she learns anything new about other John’s experience of red when she has her own first red experience herself. Lewis' has yet to show that Mary does not learn such facts.

### Problem 3

A third problem is that having an ability and knowing what it is like to exercise that ability. Mike Thau puts it as follows:

> Leon has seen red, like the rest of us, but at the age of 20 he shuts himself up in the black and white room for 30 years. Leon retains the ability to visualize red, to remember what experiences of red are like, and so on. But we can suppose that, while he's in the room, he never exercises these abilities. He hasn't visualized red or had any memories of seeing red for all that time. At the age of 50, Leon comes out of the room again, and looks at a ripe tomato. He says, "I'd forgotten what it's like to see red! Now I know again.” Mike Thau

Similarly, I know how to trim a sail. But I haven’t done it in ages. When I sail again, I will trim the sail and say, ‘wow, I had forgotten what it is like to trim a sail.’ Lewis claims that Mary learns new abilities when she sees red. But Mary seems to acquire knowledge of what it is like to exercise those abilities. So it’s unclear that acquiring abilities is the same as learning what it is like to exercise them. The point here is that Lewis wants to describe what happens when Mary leaves the room as her learning new abilities. But this doesn’t fully capture what is happening. 

## New ways of knowing the same fact

Assume that there was some knowledge that Mary lacked before leaving the room. Assume that Mary acquires new knowledge upon leaving the room. Does Mary thereby come to acquire knowledge of some new fact? Our final objection denies this. It claims that Mary has come to think about some fact she already knew in a different way. What does it mean to say that there are different ways to learn the same fact? Consider these two sentences: 

1. ‘Batman saved Gotham City from the Joker’
2. ‘Bruce Wayne saved Gotham City from the Joker’

These two sentences express the same fact, but they describe that fact in two different ways; there was only one event that happened, but we can describe in two different ways. And, I think we would agree that we can learn this one fact in different ways. Suppose that you don’t know on Monday that Batman and Bruce Wayne are numerically identical. On Monday, you would then know the first sentence without knowing the second. Suppose you learn on Tuesday that Bruce Wayne is Batman. You would then know that sentence 2 is true. But you haven’t learned some new fact by learning that 2 is true. You have learned the same fact in some new way. Similarly, our third objection claims that Mary doesn’t learn any new facts about the experience of red when she leaves the room. She only comes to know an old fact in some different way.

The problem with this response is that it is difficult to distinguish between learning some old fact in a new way and learning some brand new fact. Consider the Batman case again. When you think about Batman, you think about a caped superhero with a dark voice, no superpowers, a utility belt, and access to advanced technology. Your concept of Batman includes these various features that you associate with him. Your concept of Bruce Wayne is different. When you think about Bruce, you think about a billionaire, orphaned young when his parents were killed, someone cared for by a butler, someone relatively carefree and irresponsible. When you learn that one person is both Bruce Wayne and Batman, you realize that one person has all the various features you had associated with both, e.g., he is both a caped superhero and an orphan. You have learned that you had two concepts all along about the same person. So, it seems reasonable to say that 1 and 2 describe the one event.

Might this explain what Mary learns when she leaves the room? Let us say that P is the property of being an experience of red. Before leaving the room, Mary might have one concept for P. Namely, she has a physical concept for P, a concept which has associated with it all the various physical facts she has learned in her studies. So Mary already knows that an experience of red has property P, but she conceptualizes P as a purely physical property. When Mary leaves the room, perhaps she does not learn some new fact, namely, that the experience of red has some property distinct from P. Perhaps all she learns is a new concept for P. If so, she does not learn a new fact about the experience of P, she only learns a new way of conceptualizing that fact. Similarly, you might also learn that you can use the concept of Batman to describe somebody you were already familiar with, Bruce Wayne. 

But, this seems very unrealistic. Mary doesn’t know any of the various qualitative properties of a red experience before leaving the room. That is, she doesn’t have some haha moment and say to herself, ‘I knew about some various qualitative properties and I knew all the physical facts about some experience P, but it’s only now that I know that the experience of P has these various qualitative properties.’ Mary has no idea what it’s like to experience color. Equivalently, if I don’t know anything at all about Bruce Waynes, it’s hard to say that I only come to learn some old fact in a new way when I learn that Batman saved Gotham city. I have also learned all the facts about Bruce Wayne!
