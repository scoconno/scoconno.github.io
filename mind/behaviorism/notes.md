### Behaviorism

Statement of the view. 

Importance of behavior to mind. 

Examples of animal psychology.

There are two types of behavior: physiological response and bodily movements. 

Example of pain. Pain is not the cause of groans and winces. Pain is, in fact, identical to the pain and grimaces. There is not, on this view, anything else beside the physiological responses and bodily movements. 

“Paul has a toothache” in behavioral terms. His translation consists of the following five clauses:11
a. Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds.
b. At the question “What is the matter?” Paul utters the words, “I have a toothache.”
c. Closer examination reveals a decayed tooth with exposed pulp.
d. Paul’s blood pressure, digestive processes, the speed of his reactions, show such and such changes.
e. Such and such processes occur in Paul’s central nervous system.”


### Argument for Behaviorism

Wittgenstein's beetle in the box. Here is an example. Gaviga. Have every student use it in the group. We want to call things Gaviga. It must be about something on campus.  Have them use it in sentences saying how high and short it looks like. Then ask them whether we are talking about the same thing. We can check whether the word is referring to the same thing. 

+ The argument is from a theory of meaning. Here is something general about meaning. Words have meaning by reference. Sentences have meaning by composition of words. 

+ Verificationists think something else. 
+ I need to talk about observational sentences. 


+ I need to introduce general discussion of meaning. 

+ “The meaning of a statement consists in its method of verification”, Schlick

+ Observational sentences
+ Confirmation--you need to say that in principle something that is confirmable must be confirmable by everyone.
+ Empirically verifiable conditions for individual sentences

+ Ayer in ‘Language, Truth and Logic’ argued “A sentence is only factually significant to a person if he or she knows what observations would lead him to accept the proposition as being true or false.” (3)
+ “No statement which refers to a reality transcending the limits of all possible sense-experience can possible have any literal significance.”(3)

+ In principle vs. in practice

+ S is verifiable then if I can use one of my senses to realise it. But this must be qualified… my eyes must be open, my senses working properly, I am tall enough to see above the table, an evil demon has not made the cat invisible, I am looking in the right direction. The list is endless. 

+ Bachelors are unmarried men

+ This is  meaningful for the positivist because it is an analytic truth, somehow true by definition. 
+ Q is meaningful because the terms bachelors and unmarried men are synonymous. 
+ Two terms are synonymous if they are intersubstitutable salva veritate. 

+ But what if two terms are accidentally intersubstitutable salva veritate without being synonymous. of Renate and Cordate as two terms that are accidentally intersubstitutable salva veritate but differ in meaning.

Logical empiricism 

+ Something about no progress in many areas in comparison to the sciences. They diagnose the problem in terms of the language used in these debates. They want to say that we are speaking nonsense. 
+ Europe in 20s and 30s. Places like Vienna. Later in the US in the 50s and 60s. 
 
1. The meaning of a sentence is given by the conditions that must be verified to obtain if the sentence is true (we may call these “verification conditions”).
2. If a sentence has a meaning that can be shared by different speakers, its verification conditions must be accessible to each speaker—that is, they must be publicly observable.
3. Only behavioral and physical phenomena (including physiological occurrences) are publicly observable.
4. Therefore, the sharable meaning of any psychological sentence must be specifiable by statements of publicly observable verification “conditions, that is, statements describing behavioral and physical conditions that must hold if the psychological statement is true.




## Objections to Behaviorism

+ Knowledge of our own minds: The behaviorist explains our knowledge of other people's mental states, but tells the wrong sort of story about how we know about our own mental states. We seem to have direct access to our own minds. We don't need to observe our behavior to know how we're feeling, especially qualitative states like pain and sensory experiences. Whether I'm in pain, or having the "reddish" kind of visual experience I normally have when I look at a ripe tomato, seems to a matter of what's going on in me right now, which I can be directly aware of. It doesn't seem to be a matter of how I would act in certain hypothetical situations. 

+ Some features of mentality have characteristic ‘qualia’ or presentationally immediate or phenomenal qualities. To be in pain, for example, is not merely to produce appropriate pain behavior under the right environmental circumstances, but it is to experience a ‘like-thisness’ to the pain (as something dull or sharp, perhaps). A purely behaviorist creature, a ‘zombie’, as it were, may engage in pain behavior, including beneath the skin pain responses, yet completely lack whatever is qualitatively distinctive of and proper to pain (its painfulness).

+ Mental states do not cause anything. But we ordinarily think that behavior is caused by mental states. It is not the mental state itself. Behavior is only a sign or piece of evidence for what mental state you're in--in the same way that smoke is only a sign that there is a fire. This is why we think it's possible for someone  to be in pain without engaging in pain behavior. 

+ There are no distinctive behaviors associated with a single mental state in isolation. Any connection between mental states and behavior normally needs to invoke other mental states. It is difficult for the behaviorist to say what sorts of behavior one mental state will dispose a person towards, without making assumptions about what other mental states the person has.
	+ Consider the behaviorist's account of wanting a Caribbean vacation. X wants a Caribbean vacation iff:

1. X is disposed to read the Caribbean brochures first, if you give him a bunch of holiday brochures--this assumes that X is not already *bored* of Caribbean brochures.
2. X is disposed to pack his bags when you give him a ticket to Jamaica--this depends on whether he *believes* the flight will be canceled, whether he can afford to miss work, etc.


+ On the other hand, just because you utter the sounds "I want to go to the Caribbean," does that mean you want to go to the Caribbean? Perhaps you're being deceptive. Or perhaps you didn't even mean to be asserting anything: perhaps you made those noises as the result of a complicated hiccough.

+ The upshot of these observations seems to be that we can't find any behavior described in purely physical terms which is associated with any mental state. For instance, the behavior associated with the desire to go to the Caribbean can't just be making certain noises. *It has to be making those noises intentionally and sincerely.*

+ But if the behaviorist says this, then he's no longer talking about purely physical behavior! Contrast:

+ raising one's arm (this is mentalistic behavior) vs. one's arm moving in such-and-such ways (this is purely physical behavior)
+ intentionally saying "I want to go to the Caribbean" (this is mentalistic behavior) vs. one's mouth opening and certain noises coming out (this is purely physical behavior)
+ Many definitions smuggle back in mental terms. I believe I have a 2pm appointment. That just means I arrive there. But that doesn't seem sufficient to distinguish an appointment from something else. 



Hence, the behaviorist faces a dilemma. Either he says:

+ Creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such purely physical behavior. But then the claims he makes won't be plausible. There is no single physical way in which all creatures who are in pain behave. 
+ Alternatively, the behaviorist can say creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such mentalistic behavior. But if the behaviorist says this, then he hasn't succeeded in reducing mental facts to purely physical facts.


### Three Types of Behaviorism


1. Psychology is the science of behavior. Psychology is not the science of mind--as something other or different from behavior.

2. Behavior can be described and explained without making ultimate reference to mental events or to internal psychological processes. The sources of behavior are external (in the environment), not internal (in the mind, in the head).

3. In mental terms or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining behavior, then either (a) these terms or concepts should be eliminated and replaced by behavioral terms or (b) they can and should be translated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.
