The ones closest to us are often the ones we can read the best. I easily can judge when my wife's thoughts are elsewhere, or my brother is troubling over his mortgage. I seem to know their minds. And they seem to know mine. If Descarte were right, then my loved ones minds are identical to their souls, immaterial and invisible entities. How then could I have knowledge of their minds? I can't see their souls. But I often know what they are thinking and feeling without them telling me. How is this possible?  

The answer, of course, is that mental state correlate with behavior and behavior is something that we can see. For our purposes, there are two types of behavior, physiological responses and bodily movements. Physiological responses are those automatic reactions to a stimulus, e.g., pupil dilation, sweating, etc. We are often unaware of many of these instinctive responses, e.g., flaring our nostrils, or grinding our teeth, etc. Sometimes we are aware of them and sometimes we can stop, but the point is tha we all experience various automatic physical changes to stimuli.

A bodily movement, on the other hand, is an observable motion of some or all parts of the body. These include extending and retracting your limbs. Turning your head from left to right, etc. The below picture depicts the range of bodily movements that are characteristic of our our species.

Our mental states seem correlated with our behaviors. Attending to behaviors seems to be how we judget what mental states others are in. A person in pain tends to wince and groan. A person that is excited tends to speak in a higher pitch and have dilated pupils. These correlations between mental states and behaviors, both physiological responses and bodily movements, are the basis of some signiificant discoveries and positions in modern psychology and philosophy of mind. The focus of this section is on one such position, namely, *behaviorism*. 

The word *behaviorism* connotes a number of things and it will be important in what follows for us to isolate the philosophical position that goes by that name. But, setting aside the many intricacies and differences, behaviorists of all types approach the study of the mind via the study of behavior. For instance, a therapist who calls themselves a behaviorist will not plum the depths of their patient's dreams and childhood memories. They are more likely to focus on problematic behaviors and their triggers. Therapy may consist in avoding the triggers or being densensitized to them, e.g., treating a phobia by densitizing the patient to whatever they fear. In both cases, the goal is really focused on changing the behavior. Likewise, animal psychologists who call themselves behaviorists study the minds of their favored animals via their behaviors. They learn how, say, a lion (my favorite), behaves when encountering a new situation. And, they assume that the relevant reaction is all we need focus on to learn about the mental states of that lion. 

There are, though, different types of behaviorists, with some thinking that behaviors give clues to the mind while others thinking that behavior is all there is to the mind. Distinguish three versions of the view as follows:

Methodological Behaviorism: 
: Psychology is the science of behavior and of nothing other than behavior. This is a claim about about how to practice psychology. It says that (1) the job of the psychologists is to explain why organisms' behave they way they do, and (2) the only legitimate explanations a psychologist can offer are observable stimuli. The idea is that if psychology is to be a science then it cannot concern itself with anything as murky as the inner working of the mind. A hypothesis that, for instance, a person feels pain when they stub their toe must be testable if the hypothesis is a scientific one. And it is testable says that methodological behaviorist only if the inputs and outputs are observable by many, i.e., only if the hypothesis is about observable behaviours and stimuli. An animal psychologist, on this view, cannot talk about what a lion feels or thinks. Feelings and thoughts are not observable, so they should be no concern of the scientist.

Psychological Behaviorism: 
: Psychology is a rich discipline that must explain many things and one of these things is behavior. Even if the methodological behaviorist is wrong, there will still questions to ask about why humans and animals behave as they do. Psychological behaviorists say that the sources of behavior are exteranal and not internal, that is the causes of our behavior are always environemntla causes and never internal, mental causess. 

Philosophical, Ontological, Logical, Analytical, Radical Behaviorism:
: Mental statues just are behavioral dispositions. This is the view that concerns us and it is unfortunate that is goes by so many names. The first two behaviorisms were not theories about mental states. The first was a theory about a legitimate psychological explanation. The second was a theory about the explanation the behaviro. Both of these theories can be agnostic about mental states, about whether they exist and what they are. Our third theory is not like this. It is a theory about the nature and existence of the mind. Namely, it claims that mental states are identical to sets of behaviors or behavior dispositions. Such an identity may seem surprising. Just as Louise Lane was surprised to learn that Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same person, it would be surpising to learn that pain, for instance, just is identical to some grimaces and moans. But that's what philosophical behaviorists believe. They do not think ther are any mental states inside that skull of yours---your mental states juat are all those external, observable behavior. This means that beliefs are not some internal states of your mind. To say that a person has a belief that, say, it will rain later, just means that the person is likely to behave a certain way, e.g., carry an umbrella, say aloud the words 'it will rain', etc. The belief is not something residing internall in their mind at all. 



If mental terms or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining behavior, then either (a) these terms or concepts should be eliminated and replaced by behavioral terms or (b) they can and should be translated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.


Methodological and psychological behaviorism do not deny that we have mental states. They are perhaps agnostic. The 

Example of pain. Pain is not the cause of groans and winces. Pain is, in fact, identical to the pain and grimaces. There is not, on this view, anything else beside the physiological responses and bodily movements. 



“Paul has a toothache” in behavioral terms. His translation consists of the following five clauses:11
a. Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds.
b. At the question “What is the matter?” Paul utters the words, “I have a toothache.”
c. Closer examination reveals a decayed tooth with exposed pulp.
d. Paul’s blood pressure, digestive processes, the speed of his reactions, show such and such changes.
e. Such and such processes occur in Paul’s central nervous system.”


### Argument for Behaviorism

Wittgenstein's beetle in the box. Here is an example. Gaviga. Have every student use it in the group. We want to call things Gaviga. It must be about something on campus.  Have them use it in sentences saying how high and short it looks like. Then ask them whether we are talking about the same thing. We can check whether the word is referring to the same thing. 

+ The argument is from a theory of meaning. Here is something general about meaning. Words have meaning by reference. Sentences have meaning by composition of words. 

+ Verificationists think something else. 
+ I need to talk about observational sentences. 


+ I need to introduce general discussion of meaning. 

+ “The meaning of a statement consists in its method of verification”, Schlick

+ Observational sentences
+ Confirmation--you need to say that in principle something that is confirmable must be confirmable by everyone.
+ Empirically verifiable conditions for individual sentences

+ Ayer in ‘Language, Truth and Logic’ argued “A sentence is only factually significant to a person if he or she knows what observations would lead him to accept the proposition as being true or false.” (3)
+ “No statement which refers to a reality transcending the limits of all possible sense-experience can possible have any literal significance.”(3)

+ In principle vs. in practice

+ S is verifiable then if I can use one of my senses to realise it. But this must be qualified… my eyes must be open, my senses working properly, I am tall enough to see above the table, an evil demon has not made the cat invisible, I am looking in the right direction. The list is endless. 

+ Bachelors are unmarried men

+ This is  meaningful for the positivist because it is an analytic truth, somehow true by definition. 
+ Q is meaningful because the terms bachelors and unmarried men are synonymous. 
+ Two terms are synonymous if they are intersubstitutable salva veritate. 

+ But what if two terms are accidentally intersubstitutable salva veritate without being synonymous. of Renate and Cordate as two terms that are accidentally intersubstitutable salva veritate but differ in meaning.

Logical empiricism 

+ Something about no progress in many areas in comparison to the sciences. They diagnose the problem in terms of the language used in these debates. They want to say that we are speaking nonsense. 
+ Europe in 20s and 30s. Places like Vienna. Later in the US in the 50s and 60s. 
 
1. The meaning of a sentence is given by the conditions that must be verified to obtain if the sentence is true (we may call these “verification conditions”).
2. If a sentence has a meaning that can be shared by different speakers, its verification conditions must be accessible to each speaker—that is, they must be publicly observable.
3. Only behavioral and physical phenomena (including physiological occurrences) are publicly observable.
4. Therefore, the sharable meaning of any psychological sentence must be specifiable by statements of publicly observable verification “conditions, that is, statements describing behavioral and physical conditions that must hold if the psychological statement is true.




## Objections to Behaviorism

+ Knowledge of our own minds: The behaviorist explains our knowledge of other people's mental states, but tells the wrong sort of story about how we know about our own mental states. We seem to have direct access to our own minds. We don't need to observe our behavior to know how we're feeling, especially qualitative states like pain and sensory experiences. Whether I'm in pain, or having the "reddish" kind of visual experience I normally have when I look at a ripe tomato, seems to a matter of what's going on in me right now, which I can be directly aware of. It doesn't seem to be a matter of how I would act in certain hypothetical situations. 

+ Some features of mentality have characteristic ‘qualia’ or presentationally immediate or phenomenal qualities. To be in pain, for example, is not merely to produce appropriate pain behavior under the right environmental circumstances, but it is to experience a ‘like-thisness’ to the pain (as something dull or sharp, perhaps). A purely behaviorist creature, a ‘zombie’, as it were, may engage in pain behavior, including beneath the skin pain responses, yet completely lack whatever is qualitatively distinctive of and proper to pain (its painfulness).

+ Mental states do not cause anything. But we ordinarily think that behavior is caused by mental states. It is not the mental state itself. Behavior is only a sign or piece of evidence for what mental state you're in--in the same way that smoke is only a sign that there is a fire. This is why we think it's possible for someone  to be in pain without engaging in pain behavior. 

+ There are no distinctive behaviors associated with a single mental state in isolation. Any connection between mental states and behavior normally needs to invoke other mental states. It is difficult for the behaviorist to say what sorts of behavior one mental state will dispose a person towards, without making assumptions about what other mental states the person has.
	+ Consider the behaviorist's account of wanting a Caribbean vacation. X wants a Caribbean vacation iff:

1. X is disposed to read the Caribbean brochures first, if you give him a bunch of holiday brochures--this assumes that X is not already *bored* of Caribbean brochures.
2. X is disposed to pack his bags when you give him a ticket to Jamaica--this depends on whether he *believes* the flight will be canceled, whether he can afford to miss work, etc.


+ On the other hand, just because you utter the sounds "I want to go to the Caribbean," does that mean you want to go to the Caribbean? Perhaps you're being deceptive. Or perhaps you didn't even mean to be asserting anything: perhaps you made those noises as the result of a complicated hiccough.

+ The upshot of these observations seems to be that we can't find any behavior described in purely physical terms which is associated with any mental state. For instance, the behavior associated with the desire to go to the Caribbean can't just be making certain noises. *It has to be making those noises intentionally and sincerely.*

+ But if the behaviorist says this, then he's no longer talking about purely physical behavior! Contrast:

+ raising one's arm (this is mentalistic behavior) vs. one's arm moving in such-and-such ways (this is purely physical behavior)
+ intentionally saying "I want to go to the Caribbean" (this is mentalistic behavior) vs. one's mouth opening and certain noises coming out (this is purely physical behavior)
+ Many definitions smuggle back in mental terms. I believe I have a 2pm appointment. That just means I arrive there. But that doesn't seem sufficient to distinguish an appointment from something else. 



Hence, the behaviorist faces a dilemma. Either he says:

+ Creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such purely physical behavior. But then the claims he makes won't be plausible. There is no single physical way in which all creatures who are in pain behave. 
+ Alternatively, the behaviorist can say creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such mentalistic behavior. But if the behaviorist says this, then he hasn't succeeded in reducing mental facts to purely physical facts.


### Three Types of Behaviorism again


1. Psychology is the science of behavior. Psychology is not the science of mind--as something other or different from behavior.

2. Behavior can be described and explained without making ultimate reference to mental events or to internal psychological processes. The sources of behavior are external (in the environment), not internal (in the mind, in the head).

3. In mental terms or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining behavior, then either (a) these terms or concepts should be eliminated and replaced by behavioral terms or (b) they can and should be translated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.
