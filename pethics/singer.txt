####Singer: Famine, Affluence, and Morality###

+ Revisionary implications of accepting utilitarianism. 

+ In the world today, there are many people suffering a lot, leading miserable lives, on the margin, prone to calamity whenever natural disasters or wars or other cataclysmic events strike. Many millions of people live on an income equivalent to one dollar a day or less. 


1. Suffering and death from lack of food, shelter, and medical care are bad. 
2. If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.
3. By donating large portions of our income to charities.  it is in our power to prevent much suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. 
4. We ought, morally, donate large portions of our income to charities. 

**Strong Principle:** “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” 

**Moral Importance:*  "I mean without causing anything else comparably bad to happen, or doing something that is wrong in itself, or failing to promote some moral good, comparable in significance to the bad thing that we can prevent.”

Amounts to act utilitarianism except for (1) setting aside the demand to violate moral constraints when doing so would promote more good overall and (2) limiting itself to requiring that one prevent the most bad that one can and not requiring that one positively bring about good if nothing bad is preventable by one’s actions.

Singer is affirming, One ought morally always to do whatever would prevent the greatest amount of bad from occurring, unless one could only prevent this bad by doing something that is wrong in itself. 

So Singer is not saying that if one can prevent people from starving, but only by stealing or lying, one ought to do so (if stealing and lying are wrong in itself). 

**Example** Suppose I am walking by a pond in the woods. I’m alone. I see a small child drowning in shallow water. I could save the child easily and without risk to myself. I will suffer the slight inconvenience of getting my pants muddy, that’s all. Ask---'Would I be sacrificing something of comparable moral worth?'

**Example** Suppose my ship capsizes. Two children are drowning. I pull one child onto the life raft. There is no further room. I can save the other child only by throwing out the first or by giving up my place. Should I do either? Would I be sacrificing something of comparable moral worth to save the child?  


**Radical implications:**  Suppose my family income is $100,000 per year and, moved by the plight of distant needy strangers I have read about, I give ten dollars to a global disaster relief agency such as Oxfam or Doctors without Borders. Now I propose to go to the movies. But wait, I could instead donate another ten dollars to Oxfam. Each time I could spend excess money on myself, I would instead do more good if channeled it to distant needy strangers, until I get down to a monthly income such that my next dollar, spent on myself, would do more good than I could do by way of preventing bads by donating to poverty and famine relief. 


Roughly I would be reducing my monthly income to the level of the global poor. In effect, in a world in which large bad things happen frequently and I can significantly mitigate or block their bad effects, I morally must spend my life doing that.

Suppose we agree. Is there a morally significant difference between the drowning child case and the decision problem I face, when I could spend money on myself or instead donate resources to famine relief?

Singer: No. So if you agree that you morally must save the child in the drowning-in-the-pond example, you ought to extend the judgment, and agree with Singer that you ought to do all you can to relieve human misery around the globe, up to the point at which the dollar kept for yourself would do more good than the dollar contributed to distant needy strangers.


**Weak Principle:** “If it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening, without sacrificing anything morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it.”

I am not required to reduce my level to that of strangers. I am required to give as long as I don't sacrifice something of moral worth. 

**Case 1:** Going to the cinema. 

**Case 2:** Funds you can use for your child's education. 




#### Objections ####

**Objection 1:** The child in the example is close by and the global poor one might aid are far away, spatially distant. Also, the child will drown right now if you do not help, but in many cases, giving to relief agencies will only prevent deaths in the future.

**Singer’s reply:** Mere distance in time and distance in space are in and of themselves irrelevant to the determination of what one ought to do. It’s no less wrong to kill an innocent non threatening person if one shoots a bullet a short way or a long way in order to hit the victim.

**Objection 2:** In the drowning child example, you are the only one who could help. In the case of disaster relief, you are one of many people, perhaps millions, any of whom could help. 

**Singer’s reply:** It does not matter morally to the question, what you ought to do, how many people could help the situation. Suppose 10,000 people are on the beach, and see a child drowning in shallow water. Any of the 10,000 could help. If no one helps, all do wrong by failing to prevent the evil of the child’s death by drowning. That others could have helped does not lessen your responsibility. Of course, if another person actually moves forward to save the
child, the obligations of the others lapse.


**Objection 3:** Suppose a famine threatens, and the following holds: If everyone who could help gave ten dollars to famine relief efforts, there would be enough resources to save all who are menaced by famine; there is no reason why I should give more than anyone else in circumstances exactly similar to those I face. Conclusion: therefore, I have no obligation to give more than ten
dollars to the famine relief efforts.


**Singer’s reply:** The reasoning is faulty. The argument would be sound if the conclusion were stated hypothetically: If everyone in circumstances exactly similar to those I face gave ten dollars, I would have no obligation to give more than ten dollars. But what it would be right for me to do in nonfactual, hypothetical or imaginary circumstances does not determine what it is right for me to do in actual circumstances.

**Objection 4:** Suppose there is a drowning child on the beach, and 10,000 people could help. According to your argument, each of the 10,000 is bound to help, but if all did try to help, the result would be mass confusion and trampling of people underfoot by would-be crowds of helpers.

**Singer’s reply:** This could not happen if people were actually behaving correctly according to my principle. Once one person is observed going to the rescue, that changes the circumstances in which others decide what to do. The others are in relevantly different circumstances than the first person who acted, and they are not bound to try to help at that point (which would be
counterproductive).


**Objection 5.** The argument’s conclusion is drastically at odds with our current moral beliefs so cannot be right.


**Singer’s reply:** Why assume our current moral beliefs are all correct? I have asserted a principle, and tried to show what conduct is required by the principle. If the principle is acceptable, and the reasoning from the principle is sound, the conclusion, even if at odds with current opinions, stands.


**Objection 6:**" The imperatives of duty, strict moral requirements, only concern what is strictly necessary for people to live together peaceably in society and sustain mutually beneficial
cooperation. 

**Singer’s reply:** Morality requires us to look beyond the interests of the people in any one particular society. Morality requires impartial consideration of those who might be affected by
our choices.

**Objection 7:** “We need to have a basic moral code which is not too far beyond the capacities of the ordinary man, for otherwise there will be a general breakdown of compliance with the moral code.” The morality that Singer is proposing is far beyond the capacities of the ordinary person, so should not be accepted and established in society.

**Singer’s reply:** “The issue here is: Where should we draw the line between conduct that is required and conduct that is good although not required, so as to get the best possible result?” This looks to be a hard empirical issue, and it is far from obvious that the answer is that moral requirements should be minimal. Anyway, these types of considerations don’t apply to the firstperson question: what ought I to do. What would happen if one or another moral code were enforced against other people is clearly not relevant to the question, what makes most sense for me to do.
