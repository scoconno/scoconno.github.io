## Prompt 

Pretend that you are Epicurus. You believe that the source of all unhappiness is our fear of death. You have been asked to give a very brief presentation to the residents of New Jersey worried about the Covid epidemic. Write out the speech that you will deliver arguing that they should not fear death. 

## Further Instruction

+ Write 500-750 words. No more. No less. 
+ You are writing a speech, not a research paper. You must write for your audience. Introduce yourself. Thank them for the invitation, etc. I suggest writing in the first person.
