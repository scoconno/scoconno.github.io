title: Question and annotated bibliography

## Research project part 2

In this part of the assignment, you will do two distinct things: 

1. Submit a clearly articulated properly formed and manageable question. 
2. Submit an annotated bibliography for **five** academic sources. Each annotation must be 100-200 words. 



I will give further guidance below. 



### Task 1: Well-Formed Question

In your exploratory essay, you indicated the general area you wished to research. You now need to state a precise and well-formed manageable question about that general area. 

By **well-formed**, I mean that you must submit a question  **question**. Questions are formed with an interrogative. Here are a few examples: 

+ *which*, *what*
+ *how*
+ *why*
+ *who*, *whom*, *whose* 
+ *when*
+ *when*
+ *does*

So *what* question would you like to answer?

By **manageable**, I mean that your question must be one that is sufficiently narrow to be completed by the end of the semester. Compare the following two questions:

1. What does Socrates think about wisdom? 
2. Does Socrates in the *Apology* claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Our first question would require you to examine each work that concerns Socrates and wisdom. It's a great project. But it would take an entire book to  complete it successfully. The second question is manageable and could be completed in a couple of months. It requires you to only focus on the *Apology* and the secondary literature about this work. It also doesn't require a full discussion of everything that Socrates has to say about wisdom, but it requires that you say enough to answer the question. Here is a second example: 

1. Why did Aristotle believe that organisms are composed of both form and matter? 
1. How does Aristotle's argument in *Physics* Book 2 that material necessity alone cannot explain why teeth grow as they do support his claim that organisms are composed of both form and matter?

And here is another:

1. How does Plato's views of education compare to contemporary views of education? 
1. Is Plato's claim in *Republic* Book 2 that children should only be educated about perfect depictions about the gods compatible with treatments of religion in the curriculum at Jersey City public schools?

In both cases, Q2 is narrower than Q1. Both are manageable and could be accomplished in a short semester. Neither of the first questions is suitable for a semester long project. 



### Task 2: Annotated Bibliography

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and documents. Each citation is followed by a brief descriptive paragraph, the annotation. The purpose of the annotation is to create and collect a
small number of documents that you can use to write your large research paper. We will focus on two types of resources:

Background sources:

:   these include encyclopedia entries and textbooks. Such resources do not argue for any particular view. They explain a text and often summarize the main interpretative disputes about a text. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy are excellent. They are available online and will have suggestions for other readings.

Secondary literature:

:   these include academic research about your chosen text. Very little is agreed upon and the secondary literature is where academics argue for one interpretation over the other. These come in the form of articles published in peer review journals and books published by academic presses. Articles run normally about 30 pages. While books are obviously longer, you normally will be able to focus on one or two chapters for your project.

The **annotation**  summarizes the central theme and scope of the work. Explain how the source relates to your question. If they contain an answer, or a variety of answers, clearly state those answers. You may also compare or contrast the various works you have cited, e.g., work A defends answer X, but work B rejects answer X and argues for answer Y.
