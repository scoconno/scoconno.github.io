# Research Presentation

Great progress! You have a question. You have identified several readings that are relevant to that question. You have explained the background to your questions and sketched out some standard answers in the literature.

Now that you have surveyed the literature, it is time for you to form your own opinions on the question. Do you think one of the answers that has been defended is correct? If so, why that one as opposed to another? Do you think there is an ignored alternative? Now is the time for you to advance the conversation.

This presentation provides you the opportunity to formulate your views before writing your final paper. So, this presentation is not your final say on the matter; it is your first attempt to formulate your own views.

## Requirements 

-   Create a powerpoint presentation. All NJCU students have access to Office 365.
-   Your presentation should be **6--8 minutes maximum**.
-   Include 6--7 slides. Each slide should contain a striking picture, or quote, or graph, or other visual cue. It must also provide in bullet form a summary of the main point of the slide. You will be using your slides as cues---**do not fill your slides with text**. The 6--7 slides must be written as follows (each number corresponds to a slide):

    1. Relevant background on your topic.
    2. Question raised.
    3. Answer 1 explained
    4. Answer 2 explained
    5. Your novel contribution introduced.
    6. Evidence/support/argument for your novel contribution...you may include two slides for this.

## Alternative Modality 

Students may propose an alternative to a traditional research paper as their capstone project. If I approved your proposal to complete such an alternative, I also approved an individualized sequence of alternatives to these capstone assignments. Please consult that plan accordingly.
