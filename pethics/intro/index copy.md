When I decided to teach a course on the pandemic last year, I thought I would benefit from reflecting on the tumultuous crisis that I had navigated. I did not expect that the pandemic would still be in full swing and that the issues I grappled with in 2020 are still relevant today. By way of introduction, I want to survey a few questions I grappled with:  

1. I was going to Greece, but it was cancelled. What were my duties to my students? 
2. Married to IM physician. She was not on a front-line rotation. She was 8 months pregnant. She was moved to frontline. Asked OBGYN. She treated her like employeed. 
3. Moved to frontline. 
4. No visitors allowed to materntity wart. WTF? 
4. She left maternity leave early; showered before nursing. 
5. Daycares closed, especially for health care workers. WTF? 
6. No playgrounds. WTF?
