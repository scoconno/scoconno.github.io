## My Policy ##

Students regularly ask for extra credit and make-up work. They may not realize it, but they are asking for a an advantage over their peers---anytime one student gets an extra credit assignment that the others students do not, something unfair has occurred. I can't stomach that. I aim to teach all of my students equally and the best way for me to do that is to apply my policies fairly and equally. There are occasions when I will offer an extra credit opportunity or extend a deadline for every student in the class, e.g., a relevant event is scheduled and I want you to attend. But I will **never** give an opportunity to one student that I don't give to every. So, don't ask for special treatment---it's unfair to your fellow students.
