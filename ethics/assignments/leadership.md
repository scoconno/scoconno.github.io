## Further instructions:

+ Write 250-500 words. This word count does not include any footnote, headers, bibliography, etc. 
+ Submit your response to Blackboard as a MSWord file; each NJCU student has free access to 365 Online. 
+ Since this is a short assignment, I encourage you to only use the textbook. 
+ Include a bibliography even if you have only used your textbook; it's good practice.  
+ This is a short assignment. Do not quote extensively. Generally, you must always explain in your own words anything that you have quotes; you can't use quotes to do the work for you. 
+ I use plagiarism detection software. Failure to cite material that you use in part or full, in paraphrase or direct quotation, violates NJCU's academic integrity policy. See the syllabus for more information.
