# Research Project - Part 1

## Introduction

Independent research is a central characteristic of a college education. So, in this course, you will learn and practice research skills. To that end, you will work on an independent project through the semester. We will scaffold that project around a few basic skills and tasks to practice those skills (see syllabus for assignment due dates). In this first part, we will work on starting your research, on asking a research question and identifying some research material. 

This first assignment has **three tasks**:

1. Ask a clearly articulated properly formed and manageable question. You must use an interrogative. I also expect to see a question mark. See below.
2. Write 250-500 words that motivates your question
3. Submit an annotated bibliography for **five** academic sources. Each annotation must be 100-200 words. 

I provide further information on each task. 

## Alternative Modality 

Students may propose an alternative to a traditional research paper as their capstone project. If you are interested in this option, please consult with me and I will adjust the various capstone assignments accordingly. 



## Task 1: A Well-Formed and Manageable Question
The first task asks you to ask a well-formed and manageable ethical question about the pandemic. To do this, consider the material we have covered so far and skim the topics in the textbook. If one seems interesting to you, then read a bit further to see whether you might want to spend a semester working on it. At this stage, your interest will be very broad and perhaps confused. That's fine. Research starts in this confused way, and it gets clearer as we progress.  Do not expect to identify an interesting research project before reading through material in the textbook. 

By **well-formed**, I mean you must ask a **question**. Questions are formed with an interrogative. Here are a few examples: 

+ *which*, *what*
+ *how*
+ *why*
+ *who*, *whom*, *whose* 
+ *when*
+ *when*
+ *does*

So *what* question would you like to answer this semester? 

By **manageable**, I mean that your question must be one that is sufficiently narrow to be completed by the end of the semester. Compare the following two questions:

1. What does Socrates think about wisdom? 
2. Does Socrates in the *Apology* claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Our first question would require you to examine each work that concerns Socrates and wisdom. It's a great project. But it would take an entire book to  complete it successfully. The second question is manageable and could be completed in a couple of months. It requires you to only focus on the *Apology* and the secondary literature about this work. It also doesn't require a full discussion of everything that Socrates has to say about wisdom, but it requires that you say enough to answer the question. Here is a second example: 

1. Why did Aristotle believe that organisms are composed of both form and matter? 
1. How does Aristotle's argument in *Physics* Book 2 that material necessity alone cannot explain why teeth grow as they do support his claim that organisms are composed of both form and matter?

And here is another:

1. How does Plato's views of education compare to contemporary views of education? 
1. Is Plato's claim in *Republic* Book 2 that children should only be educated about perfect depictions about the gods compatible with treatments of religion in the curriculum at Jersey City public schools?

In both cases, Q2 is narrower than Q1. Both are manageable and could be accomplished in a short semester. Neither of the first questions is suitable for a semester long project. 


## Task 2: Background motivation

The second task asks you to provide context and background to your topic. This context provides enough detail to explain why your topic is something that requires further research and study. Suppose you encounter this question: 

+ Does Socrates claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Suppose further you have never heard of Socrates. You would be so unanchored that you wouldn't even know the relevant area the question concerned. You definitely wouldn't know enough to care about answering that question. Now suppose that the author prefaced their question with the following: 

> Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher, is famous for claiming in the *Apology* that he is wise because he does not take himself to know what he does not know. But he doesn't explain what wisdom amounts to. The very little he says seems to leave open the possibility that a person who knew nothing at all could be wise. As long as they didn't claim to have knowledge, they would be wise. But lots of thing satisfy this description. My cat does. She doesn't claim to have knowledge. Does that make her wise? It does from a simple reading of Socrates' claim. 
>
> So, we want to take a closer look at Socrates' account of wisdom. Perhaps he believes that the wise person is not merely silent about their lack of knowledge but is also aware of that lack. That kind of awareness is not something my cat possesses. But if this isn't the relevant addition, is there anything else to Socrates' account of wisdom that would avoid the conclusion that my cat is wise? 


When we provide our readers sufficient context like this, they understand what we want to write about, and they often want to read what we have to say. So, for this assignment, you will write some context and background for your topic. My example here is quite short, but you need to write 250--500 words. To fill out the exploration, you could, in this instance, discuss the context in which Socrates' disavows knowledge but asserts wisdom, or you could read some scholarly literature and sketch how others interpret it. If your topic was more historical, on say how Plato's ideal state in the *Republic* compares to Sparta's militaristic society, you could provide background research on Sparta. There are various forms your exploration could take depending on your particular interests. But the exploration must be *research focused*. Do not tell me you want to research a topic because you have always wondered about something, or because you once experienced something, or you once saw something. That's not research. 


## Task 3: Annotated Bibliography

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and documents. Each citation is followed by a brief descriptive paragraph, the annotation. The purpose of the annotation is to create and collect a small number of documents that you can use to write your large research paper. We will focus on two types of resources:

Background sources:

:   these include encyclopedia entries and textbooks. Such resources do not argue for any particular view. They explain a text and often summarize the main interpretative disputes about a text. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy are excellent. They are available online and will have suggestions for other readings.

Secondary literature:

:   these include academic research about your chosen text. Very little is agreed upon and the secondary literature is where academics argue for one interpretation over the other. These come in the form of articles published in peer review journals and books published by academic presses. Articles run normally about 30 pages. While books are obviously longer, you normally will be able to focus on one or two chapters for your project.

The **annotation**  summarizes the central theme and scope of the work. Explain how the source relates to your question. If they contain an answer, or a variety of answers, clearly state those answers. You may also compare or contrast the various works you have cited, e.g., work A defends answer X, but work B rejects answer X and argues for answer Y.

Note the following: 

1. Use the library databases and resources only. They are reliable. 
2. Wikipedia, youtube, quora, youtube transcripts, your hunches, etc., are not academic sources. The written sources must be either articles that are published in peer reviewed scholarly journals or books published by scholarly presses. 
4. An entire section of the library, and several librarians, are entirely focused to helping users find material for their research. Details [here](https://www.njcu.edu/library/about-library/library-departments/reference-department).
