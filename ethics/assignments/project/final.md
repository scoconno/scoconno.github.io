## Sections of the final paper

It is time to write the full and final draft of your project. You must write **1750-2000** words. Your paper must include the following parts:

1. State your research question as your title; your research question must have been adjusted in response to my comments. 
2. Write a clear introduction that provides a nice shared context; this introduction must be expanded and adjusted in response to my comments. 
3. Write a literature review; this must be heavily edited in a way that clearly takes into account all my comments on your previous submission. 
4. Your assessment; this is a write-up of the material you included in your presentation. 
5. Bibliography. 

## Alternative Modality 

Students may propose an alternative to a traditional research paper as their capstone project. If I approved your proposal to complete such an alternative, I also approved an individualized sequence of alternatives to these capstone assignments. Please consult that plan accordingly. 


## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
