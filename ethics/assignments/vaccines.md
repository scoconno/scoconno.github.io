title: Morality & Vaccines
---

## Introduction
Pick one of the ethical theories discussed in this course so far. Use that theory to argue that each individual has a moral obligation to get vaccinated against Covid-19 despite any adverse effects to the vaccines. Make sure to devote a good paragraph to explain the particular ethical theory you pick before turning to apply it to the topic of the moral obligation to get vaccinated. 



## Further instructions:

+ Write 250-500 words. This word count does not include any footnote, headers, bibliography, etc. 
+ Submit your response to Blackboard as a MSWord file; each NJCU student has free access to 365 Online. 
+ Since this is a short assignment, I encourage you to only use the textbook. 
+ Include a bibliography even if you have only used your textbook; it's good practice.  
+ This is a short assignment. Do not quote extensively. Generally, you must always explain in your own words anything that you have quotes; you can't use quotes to do the work for you. 
+ I use plagiarism detection software. Failure to cite material that you use in part or full, in paraphrase or direct quotation, violates NJCU's academic integrity policy. See the syllabus for more information.
