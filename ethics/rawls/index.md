# Justice as Fairness


+ [Distributive Justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/#Difference), J. Lamont & C. Favor

	> Principles of distributive justice are therefore best thought of as providing moral guidance for the political processes and structures that affect the distribution of benefits and burdens in societies, and any principles which do offer this kind of moral guidance on distribution, regardless of the terminology they employ, should be considered principles of distributive justice.
