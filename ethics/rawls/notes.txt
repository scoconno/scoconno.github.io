# John Rawls: Original position and the veil of ignorance

One of the most important and influential theories of justice has been proposed by US philosopher John Rawls (1921-2002) in his book “A Theory of Justice” (1971).

## The Original Position

Rawls was interested in how we make just decisions.  
The basic idea of Rawls is that, in order to make just choices, we should imagine ourselves as being in this world, but not being ourselves as we are now. Instead, try to imagine you are conscious before you are actually born as a particular individual. Perhaps like we would imagine a soul that is waiting to be born into a human body — it is already there, waiting, but it doesn’t know in which body it will eventually end up (the wacky explanation is mine, not Rawls’). This situation Rawls calls the “original position.” This is the point at which we are able to make decisions, but we are not yet committed to a particular camp, to a particular nation, a gender, a religion, a social class, a family, a body. In the uncertainty of this original position, it seems equally likely that we will be born as a farmer in India, a businessman in Shanghai, a mother of seven in rural Alaska, or a war orphan in Syria.

In this situation now, imagine that you’re looking down on Earth, trying to create rules for a just society, not knowing as who of all those people down there you will eventually be born. This “not-knowing” Rawls calls the “veil of ignorance”. This veil is like a curtain that hides the (future) reality from your view.

Rawls believes that if we create rules and laws in this way, we are more likely to create a truly just society than if we do it from our present perspective as the person we happened to be born as.

Rawls’ two principles of justice

From this original position, Rawls thinks, we would arrive at the following three principles of justice (he speaks of two, but the second has two parts, so somehow it seems clearer to say that there are really three of them):

The Liberty Principle. All citizens should have equal basic liberties: freedom of conscience, association, expression and personal property.

The Fair Equality of Opportunity. Offices and positions should be open and effectively accessible to all. (It’s interesting to compare this to Nussbaum’s concept of capabilities).

The Difference Principle. Any inequalities are only permitted if they work to the advantage of the least well-off.

Let’s now briefly think how we can apply these principles to international vaccine distribution.

When we think about how to regulate vaccine access, we should do so from “behind the veil,” that is, assuming that we don’t yet know as who we will be born on this Earth. So you wouldn’t try to regulate vaccine access knowing that you are a German teacher, an Indian programmer, a US farmer, or a Japanese monk. Instead, you would assume that you might be in any of these roles, having to deal with the consequences of your regulation.

And the crucial question is: How would you regulate then?

Vaccinations and the Liberty Principle

Rawls’ first principle is about equal basic liberties for all citizens: freedom of conscience, association, expression and personal property. Applied to the vaccine question, we see that basic access to healthcare is a necessary condition for most of the other liberties. What good is my freedom of expression if I’m dead from the virus? Of course, there is also a conflict here: What should happen if someone does not want to be vaccinated? On the one hand, we want to respect their liberty. But on the other hand, exercising their liberty will make it more likely that they will endanger others by transmitting the virus to them.


Fair Equality of Opportunity

According to Rawls, offices and positions should be open and effectively accessible to all. In terms of vaccinations, we might understand this to mean that access to the vaccine (and therefore affordable healthcare) should be available equally to all. It cannot only be a privilege of rich countries, or rich citizens within a country.


The Difference Principle

Any inequalities are only permitted if they work to the advantage of the least well-off.

This principle breaks the symmetry of the previous one. If we need to distribute vaccines unequally, perhaps because not enough are available at a given moment, we should always restrict in favour of the poorer, least well-off countries and individuals. That means, richer countries and individuals, who have more resources to combat the virus and to recover in the case of an infection, should prioritise giving the vaccine to those who don’t have the same high-quality medical infrastructure available in their countries.

Any inequalities are only permitted if they work to the advantage of the least well-off. Tweet!
Why should we do that? Why should we give the advantage to the least well-off? For Rawls, this is not “being nice” or anything like that. It is the rational result of creating these rules in the original position, behind one’s veil of ignorance. If you didn’t know whether you will be born as Bill Gates or a farmer in Syria, but you had to make a rule to make the vaccine available first to one of the two: who would it be?


Obviously, if you were to be Bill Gates, you would be able to take care of yourself, even without the vaccine. But as the farmer in Syria, you might have no way to survive an infection. So assuming I really didn’t know who of these two will be my next incarnation, it would be perfectly rational to give access to the vaccine to the Syrian farmer first. (Bill Gates is just a name here; I am aware that he is a great philanthropist and much more generous with his wealth than most of the others who have amassed similar fortunes).

And that’s the end of today’s article. We began with the question of how we should distribute a scarce vaccine among countries or individuals of different financial means. And we saw that the problem is not easy — but if we commit to Rawls’ assumptions, then it seems that we would not only have to agree to share the vaccine with those who are less wealthy; we would, in fact, have to prioritise them.


1. Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.

2. Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: (a) They are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and (b), they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society. (Rawls 1993, pp. 5–6. The principles are numbered as they were in Rawls’ original A Theory of Justice.)
