\section{Disclaimer}
 This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the faculty. Students will be notified of such changes ahead of time via Blackboard. 

\section{Covid-19 Policies}
I am very much looking forward to the day when the pandemic is behind us, but weâ€™re not quite there yet. In order to keep each other safe, please review and follow NJCU's Covid-19 related policies here:  
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://www.njcu.edu/student-life/campus-services-resources/health-wellness-center/guidelines-spring-2022-semester}{https://www.njcu.edu/student-life/campus-services-resources/health-wellness-center/guidelines-spring-2022-semester}
\end{itemize}
If you are unwell or think you have been exposed to Covid-19, do not attend class. If I test positive, must isolate due to exposure, or my children must isolate, I will teach the course on zoom through the length of my isolation. 


\section{Copyright}
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Course Description}

This course examines ethical issues connected with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the fair allocation of scarce medical resources, immunity passports, trade-offs between protecting senior citizens and allowing children to flourish, discrimination against minorities and the disabled, and the myriad issues raised by vaccines.

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course students will be able to (i)  determine social, political, economic, philosophical, and other implications of the pandemic, (ii) demonstrate an understanding of the ethical issues raised by the Covid-19 pandemic, and (iii) analyze ways ethical questions about the pandemic arise in their respective disciplines.

I will accommodate students who have extended absences due to illness or covid-19 isolation. Students must notify me.
