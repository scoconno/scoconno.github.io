Postules on skin. 

Following the incubation period, a sudden onset of flu-like signs and symptoms occurs. These include:

Fever
Overall discomfort
Headache
Severe fatigue
Severe back pain
Vomiting, possibly
A few days later, flat, red spots appear first on your face, hands and forearms, and later on your trunk. Within a day or two, many of these lesions turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid, which then turns into pus. Scabs begin to form eight to nine days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars.


Indigenous people of the Americas had no inherited immunity, it was devastating. Killed 9 out of 10 million in the Yucatan province alone by the 1600s overed skins with sores. Postules erupted, even face. Could kill 1/3 of infected. And the impact of those surviving was terrible. In the America it was so much worse. MOre than 50% had it. It was newer to the colonies. It devastated the Incas. 
Inoculatred with mild doses. 

Jenner 1796 Lymph. Lance sore. Collected fluid. Scratched skin. Put lymph into skin. Smear onto thread. seal in wax, etc. Go to next town and reconstitute it. Scratch people arm and legs. What about long distance? Dried lymph would lose its virulence? Would lose it across ocean. Got to Newfindland. Just didn't work. Viruses can't solve. 

Questions about blankets and intentional spread to the native americans. 

Spain needed to save lives. Also introduce disease in the first place. King Carlos seemed sincere. Lost both brother and daugther to stopping it. Medical advisors came up with a solution - chain of orphan boys. Right before departure, they would get cowpox. Postules would erupt. They would lance and then infect the next pair of boys. Ten days later, they did the same thing. So, the chain would continue in the boat. One kid had one postule left when they got to Caracas. Ultimatley Phillipines. (Loads of people vaccinated). 
Kids were prevented from scratching the postules. X number of orphans pain/suffering vs hundreds of thousands lives saved. 

### Yellow Fever-immunoprivilege
Yellow-fever details. Caused by a virus spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms includes causes chills, aches, vomiting, and sometimes jaundice, which gives yellow fever its name. They vomited thick black blood. 

Symptoms

During the first three to six days after you've developed yellow fever — the incubation period — you won't experience any signs or symptoms. After this, the infection enters an acute phase and then, in some cases, a toxic phase that can be life-threatening.

Acute phase

Once the infection enters the acute phase, you may experience signs and symptoms including:

Fever
Headache
Muscle aches, particularly in your back and knees
Sensitivity to light
Nausea, vomiting or both
Loss of appetite
Dizziness
Red eyes, face or tongue
These signs and symptoms usually improve and are gone within several days.

Toxic phase

Although signs and symptoms may disappear for a day or two following the acute phase, some people with acute yellow fever then enter a toxic phase. During the toxic phase, acute signs and symptoms return and more-severe and life-threatening ones also appear. These can include:

Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
Abdominal pain and vomiting, sometimes of blood
Decreased urination
Bleeding from your nose, mouth and eyes
Slow heart rate
Liver and kidney failure
Brain dysfunction, including delirium, seizures and coma


Those who recover from an initial infection are immune after a first bout. Before vaccination and treatments, it used to kill 50% of those infected with it. Europeans had no inherited immunity and it affected them worse tgan the people the 
15% death but varies

In the mid-1800s, New Orleans, was ravaged by Yellow Fever; it killed about 150,000 there alone. The way New Orleans responded to yellow fever raises several questions about immunoprivilege, question also raised by status certificates, vaccinate mandates, vaccinate passports, etc. We'll be talking about these issues in relation to Covid-19 later in the semester, but it's worth considering now some  

Since yellow fever was so deadly, it greatly disrupted the economy and the social order. Employers did not wish to hire those who had not acquired immunity--they did not wish to train emloyees who could easily die. Slave owners--New Orleans was a slave society--placed special value on slaves who has recovered from yellow fever with slaves with acquired immunity costing 50% more than slave who had no immunity. Over time, a immunity based hierarchy emerged amongst whites, with acclimated whites standing above unacclimated whites. with whites who had reoceer  came to 
It was so disruptive that acquired immunity to yellow fever became a privilege, with it nearly being a prerequisite for employment, marriage, loans, rentals, etc. This was called at the time, “acclimation,” and “baptism of citizenship”. The president of the New Orlean’s Board of Health once proclaimed in a speech, “The VALUE OF ACCLIMATION IS WORTH THE RISK!”

'Antebellum New Orleans was a slave society where whites dominated free people of color and enslaved people through legally sanctioned violence. But another invisible hierarchy came to co-mingle with the racial order; white “acclimated citizens” stood atop the social pyramid, followed by white “unacclimated strangers,” followed by everyone else. Surviving yellow fever was locally known as the “baptism of citizenship:” proof that a white person had been chosen by God and had established himself as a legitimate and permanent player in the Cotton Kingdom.'

Instead of avoiding yellow fever, new citizens to the city often sought yellow fever out. 


When a young man named Isaac H. Charles arrived in yellow-fever-ravaged New Orleans in 1847, he did not, as one might expect, try to avoid the deadly disease, which killed as many as half of its victims at the time. He welcomed yellow fever—and, more importantly, the lifelong immunity he would have if he survived it. Luckily, he did. “It is with great pleasure,” he wrote to his cousin, “that I am able to tell you with certainty, that both [my brother] Dick & I are acclimated.”

Overview

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.

HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.

There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but medications can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations.

Symptoms

The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.

Primary infection (Acute HIV)

Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within two to four weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include:

Fever
Headache
Muscle aches and joint pain
Rash
Sore throat and painful mouth sores
Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck
Diarrhea
Weight loss
Cough
Night sweats
These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.

Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV)

In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time.

This stage can last for many years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner.

Symptomatic HIV infection

As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:

Fever
Fatigue
Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection
Diarrhea
Weight loss
Oral yeast infection (thrush)
Shingles (herpes zoster)
Pneumonia
Progression to AIDS

Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years.

When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system.

The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:

Sweats
Chills
Recurring fever
Chronic diarrhea
Swollen lymph glands
Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth
Persistent, unexplained fatigue
Weakness
Weight loss
Skin rashes or bumps



In 1981, hundres of gy people became mysteriously ill, and the CDC didn't know much about it. Great ideology related to it. Initially, considered only a disease that gay men could get. but babies of drug dependent got it by 1984 and eventually research lined up. 
In the 80s they thought blood could be the way it was spread, and CDC urged screening of donated blood. ELISA in 1984 - 342 deaths caused by infected donated blood at lrast by ebd of 985

Another policeman tells Colin’s mother her son is “infectious”, saying: “We’ve been granted a court order for his detention, under the Public Health Act of 1984. No one is allowed in, and he’s certainly not allowed out.” Colin’s mum asks if he’s “under arrest”, and is told Colin is a “public menace” who is “dangerous to others”
