## Sample Issues

### Smallpox-Orphans

Cowpox, dilemma - how to get it to people? 

Postules on skin. Lymph. Lance sore. Collected fluid. Scratched skin. Put lymph into skin. Smear onto thread. seal in wax, etc. Go to next town and reconstitute it. Scratch people arm and legs. What about long distance? Dried lymph would lose its virulence? Would lose it across ocean. Got to Newfindland. Just didn't work. Viruses can't solve. 

Covered skins with sores. Postules erupted, even face. Could kill 1/3 of infected. And the impact of those surviving was terrible. In the America it was so much worse. MOre than 50% had it. It was newer to the colonies. It devastated the Incas. N

Questions about blankets and intentional spread to the native americans. 

Spain needed to save lives. Also introduce disease in the first place. King Carlos seemed sincere. Lost both brother and daugther to stopping it. Medical advisors came up with a solution - chain of orphan boys. Right before departure, they would get cowpox. Postules would erupt. They would lance and then infect the next pair of boys. Ten days later, they did the same thing. So, the chain would continue in the boat. One kid had one postule left when they got to Caracas. Ultimatley Phillipines. (Loads of people vaccinated). 
Kids were prevented from scratching the postules. X number of orphans pain/suffering vs hundreds of thousands lives saved. 

### Yellow Fever-immunoprivilege
Yellow-fever details. Caused by a virus spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms includes causes chills, aches, vomiting, and sometimes jaundice, which gives yellow fever its name. They vomited thick black blood. Those who recover from an initial infection are immune after a first bout. Before vaccination and treatments, it used to kill 50% of those infected with it. 

In the mid-1800s, New Orleans, was ravaged by Yellow Fever; it killed about 150,000 there alone. The way New Orleans responded to yellow fever raises several questions about immunoprivilege, question also raised by status certificates, vaccinate mandates, vaccinate passports, etc. We'll be talking about these issues in relation to Covid-19 later in the semester, but it's worth considering now some  

Since yellow fever was so deadly, it greatly disrupted the economy and the social order. Employers did not wish to hire those who had not acquired immunity--they did not wish to train emloyees who could easily die. Slave owners--New Orleans was a slave society--placed special value on slaves who has recovered from yellow fever with slaves with acquired immunity costing 50% more than slave who had no immunity. Over time, a immunity based hierarchy emerged amongst whites, with acclimated whites standing above unacclimated whites. with whites who had reoceer  came to 
It was so disruptive that acquired immunity to yellow fever became a privilege, with it nearly being a prerequisite for employment, marriage, loans, rentals, etc. This was called at the time, “acclimation,” and “baptism of citizenship”. The president of the New Orlean’s Board of Health once proclaimed in a speech, “The VALUE OF ACCLIMATION IS WORTH THE RISK!”

'Antebellum New Orleans was a slave society where whites dominated free people of color and enslaved people through legally sanctioned violence. But another invisible hierarchy came to co-mingle with the racial order; white “acclimated citizens” stood atop the social pyramid, followed by white “unacclimated strangers,” followed by everyone else. Surviving yellow fever was locally known as the “baptism of citizenship:” proof that a white person had been chosen by God and had established himself as a legitimate and permanent player in the Cotton Kingdom.'

Instead of avoiding yellow fever, new citizens to the city often sought yellow fever out. 


When a young man named Isaac H. Charles arrived in yellow-fever-ravaged New Orleans in 1847, he did not, as one might expect, try to avoid the deadly disease, which killed as many as half of its victims at the time. He welcomed yellow fever—and, more importantly, the lifelong immunity he would have if he survived it. Luckily, he did. “It is with great pleasure,” he wrote to his cousin, “that I am able to tell you with certainty, that both [my brother] Dick & I are acclimated.”
