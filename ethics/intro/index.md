When I decided to teach a course on the pandemic last year, I thought I would benefit from reflecting on the tumultous crisis that I had navigated. I did not expect that the pandemic would still be in full swing and that the issues I grappled with in 2020 are still relevant today. This course, then, is not just for your benefit. It is something I need too. By way of introduction, I want to explain my experiences and why I need it.
