\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

What a case! You have never seen one like it in all these years of
working for the Gothic Knight Law Firm. A gorilla called Koko? Your
clients want you to petition the courts for emancipation. That will be
tough. You need to convince the courts that keeping Koko in captivity is
as bad as keeping a human being in captivity. The case raises all kinds
of tricky philosophical issues, but you settle on a strategy. Logical
behaviorism is a theory of mind that shows Koko to enjoy mentality as
much as any human being does. You first need to take a careful note of
behaviors that most resemble those of a human being. Observation in
hand, you can then use use logical behaviorism to prove that she has a
mind. You can watch Koko here

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    An explanation of logical behaviorism and the argument for it.
  \item
    An application of this theory to Koko and her behavior (which you
    outlined in the `facts' section.)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{NB:} Failure to include any of these elements 
will result in a loss of points.

\subsubsection{Word Count}\label{word-count}

500-750 words long. Submissions shorter than 500 words or
longer than 750 words will lose points.


\subsubsection{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that
you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and
handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials
than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant
overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against
Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you
include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for
the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a
report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your
permanent academic record.

\subsubsection{Due Date}\label{due-date}

Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

\subsubsection{Late Submissions}\label{late-submissions}

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be
accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you
foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal
or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit
it early.
