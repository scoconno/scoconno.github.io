## Introduction

Minds are special sorts 


We divide the world into those that live and those don't. We divide those that live into those that have a mind and those that don't. There are creatures that are conscious and can experience things like pain and pleasure. 
+ Consider the controversies over animals, whether they should be eaten and whether they should be tested upon. 
.+ Cats and dogs experience sensation, perceive their surroundings, remember things, learn from their experiences, seem to have emotions. What about more complex emotions? 
+ What about when we move down the animal chain to oysters and insects? They seem to perceive their environment, but do they have a mind? 
+ What about machines? 


We can only answer these questions if know what it is to have a mind. 


## What is philosophy of mind? 

The mind is studied by disciplines ranging from psychology, to cognitive science, to neuroscience. What does philosophy have to offer in addition to these disciplines? If you wanted to learn about cells, you would ask the cell biologist and be surprised if the philosopher had anything to add in addition to the biologist. 

One think philosophers do is identify and clarify which questions must be answered if we are to fully understand the nature of mind. A biological cell is a target that we can all identify. The questions we must ask about this target are relevantly clear. Not so with the mind. Disciplines do not yet even agree on which questions are the relevant questions. Should we be focused merely on the way brain processes information? Must we also understand how a person represent their environment to themselves? What exactly are those questions that must be asked about the mind? 

A philosopher here responds that before we can answer whether something has a mind, we need to identify the marks of mentality. Before we can know, for instance, whether a scientist has offered a full and exhaustive account of consciousness, we need to identify the marks of consciousness, something we will focus on at the end of this semester.

A good place to start is by noticing the vast variety of mental phenomena, or 'mental state'. We will often talk about mental states in this class. They are roughly states of the mind as opposed to states of the body, e.g., the thought of ice-cream on a hot day is a mental state, a state you are in when thinking about ice-cream. The acid in your stomach digesting that stomach is a state of your body and not your mind. 

There are a large group of mental states that we might call phenomenal or qualitative states. Amongst these are included  1) sensations like pains, itches, tickles, etc. 2) Perceptions, mental states we are in when we have an experience, or apparent experience, of the external world whether it be a sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. So, for instance, when you see the ice-cream cone, the seeing is one mental state, when you taste the ice-cream, the tasting is a different mental state, when you feel the ice-cream running down your fingers, the feeling is yet another mental state, etc. And when dog licks your hand, the tickle the dog causes is yet another mental state. Some of these mental states, especially perceptions, seem primarily to give us information about the world, something other than your body. Others, the sensations, seem primarily to give us informaiton about our body. Despite all these differences, though, all these mental states seem similar in one important respect, each has its own distinctive feel that is essential to it. There is a feel to pain that makes pain the mental state it is. There is a different feel to seeing green that make  it the particular mental state it is. It will be one of our main tasks in this course to get clearer on what these 'feels' are and to understand how exactly we have access to them. 

+  “Second, there are mental states that are attributed to a person by the use of embedded that-clauses: for example, President Barack Obama hopes that Congress will pass a health-care bill this year; Senator Harry Reid is certain that this will happen, and Newt Gingrich doubts that Obama will get what he wants. Such states are called “propositional attitudes.” The idea is that these states consist in a subject’s having an “attitude” (for example, hoping, being certain, doubting, and believing) toward a “proposition” (for example, that Congress will pass a health-care bill, that it will rain tomorrow). The propositions are said to constitute the “content” of the propositional attitudes, and that-clauses that specify these propositions are called “content sentences.” Thus, the content of Obama’s hope is the proposition that Congress will pass a health-care bill this year, which is also the content of Gingrich’s doubt, and this content is expressed by the sentence “Congress will pass a health-care bill this year.” These states are also called “intentional”8 or “content-bearing” states.”

+ “And then there are various mental states that come under the broad heading of feelings and emotions. They include anger, joy, sadness, depression, elation, pride, embarrassment, remorse, regret, shame, and many others. Notice that emotions are often attributed to persons with a that-clause. In other words, some states of emotions involve propositional attitudes: For example, you could be embarrassed that you had forgotten to call your mother on her birthday, and she could be disappointed that you did. Further, some emotions involve belief: If you are embarrassed that you had forgotten your mother’s birthday, you must believe that you did. As the word feeling suggests, there is often a special qualitative component we associate with many emotions, such as anger and grief, although it is not certain that all instances of emotion are accompanied by such qualitative feels, or that there is a single specific sensory feel to each kind of emotion.”
+ “There are also what some philosophers call “volitions,” like intending, deciding, and willing. These states are propositional attitudes; intentions and decisions have content.”

## Marks of the Mental 

+ We have direct or immediate knowledge of the mental
+ Privacy or first person privilege: only you can directly know your mental states. 
+ knowledge of our own mental states is infallible. 
+ “This feature of the mental—namely, that mental states are about, or are directed upon, objects that may or may not exist or have contents that may or may not be true—has been called “intentionality.” “Broadly speaking, intentionality refers to the mind-world relation—specifically, the fact that our thoughts relate to, or hook up with, the things in the world, and represent how things are in the world. The idea at bottom is the thought that mentality is the capacity for representing the world around us, and that this is one of its essential functions. In short, the mind is a repository of inner representations—an inner mirror—of the outer world. ”

“first, conscious states, in particular sensory or qualitative states (those with “qualia”), like pains and sensings of colors and textures, and, second, intentional states, states with representational contents, like beliefs, desires, and intentions. The former seem to be paradigm cases of states that satisfy the epistemic criteria of the mental, such as direct access and privacy, and the latter are the prime examples of mental states that satisfy the intentionality criterion. An important question that is still open is this: In virtue of what common property are both sensory states and intentional states “mental”? ”

We will focus on three topics: 
Mind-body problem: they are so different from one another, but they are intimately connected. Change one and you change the other. There are atoms and molecules that make up cells and tissues. But these seem very different from the feeling of pleasure, the contemplation of a great work of art. 


Conscious experiences relate to our biological nature, but how? When c-fibre fire, we feel pain? What is the relationship between the sensation and the physical? How can the physical give rise to the mental? Relatedly, could sufficiently complex systems made from inorganic matter, i.e., machines, give rise to the mental? Our beliefs cause us to do things, but how could beliefs cause our neurons to fire and so cause our bodies to move? Biologist will tell us how the neurons firing will cause the muscles to contract, but how do beliefs and desires cause the neurons to fire in the first place. Could beliefs do this because they are themselves physical? Philosophy will tell us whether causality require beliefs and desires to be physical.
