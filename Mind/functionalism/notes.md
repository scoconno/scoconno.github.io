title: Mind-Brain Identity Theory

---

## Mind-Brain Identity Theory

+ J. J. C. Smart is one of the best-known 20th Century identity theorists.
+ Type of mental state = type of brain state (properties of the mind are identical to properties of the brain)
	+  A brain state is what is “going on” in your brain, i.e., nerve cells firing
	+  A “mental state” is just a “state” or condition some “mind” might be in, like “seeing,” or “thinking,” “being in pain,” etc. So, thoughts, pains, desires, beliefs, etc., are all “mental states.”
+ Compare: The property of being water = the property of being H2O.


## Arguments for Mind-Brain Identity Theory

### 1. Occam's Razor

Occam's (or Ockham's) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham.  Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born. The principle states:

>  Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.  

> Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate"
> Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora"
> Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem"


 Isaac Newton stated the rule: "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."

Distinguish two types of simplicity: 

1. Axiom simplicity: the number and conciseness of the theory's basic principles. 
2. Ontological simplicity: the number of kinds of entities postulated by the theory. 



### 2. Causation

1. Mental events cause physical events.
2. Only physical events can cause physical events.
3. Mental events are physical events, i.e., are identical to brain events.


## Arguments against Mind-Brain Identity Theory

All the arguments below will rely on what is called Leibniz' Law

+ If A and B are numerically identical, then A and B are qualitatively identical, i.e., they must have exactly the same properties.
+ If A and B have different properties, then A and B are not numerically identical. 

If Mind-Brain Identity Theory is correct, then Leibniz Law requires the following:

+ If mental state A and brain state B are numerically identical, then A and B are qualitatively identical. 

If, on the other hand, A and B vary in even one property, they A and B are not numerically identical. 

### Application 1

1. I can be certain of my mental states (e.g., pain).
2. I cannot be certain of my brain states.
3. So, mental states have properties (of being such that I can be certain of them) that brain states lack.
4. So, mental states cannot be identical to brain states.


Question: does Leibniz Law apply to *intensional* properties? 

### Application 2

1. I am experiencing a purple after-image.
2. No brain states are purple.
3. So my after-image is not identical with any brain state.


Question: is my after-image really purle? 


### Application 3--Multiple Realizability 

The multiple realizability thesis states that a single mental kind (property, state, event) can be realized by many distinct physical kinds (property, state, event).


1. Pain has the property of being correlated with C-fibres firing in humans. 
2. Pain does not have the property of being correlated with C-fibres firing in sharks. 
3. Pain is not identical to C-fibres firing. 


Note 1: premise 2 could be replaced with examples of plants feeling pain, non-carbon based life-form feeling pain, synthetic creatures (robots) feeling pain.

Note 2: do these things really feel pain? If they do, is their feeling of pain the same type of mental state as the pain humans feel?
