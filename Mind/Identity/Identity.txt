## Mind as the Brain ##

They're made out of meat questions!!

- Where are mind and thoughts located--the head!
- Mind is identical to the brain. Explain identity. 
- For a creature to have a mentality is to have a brain with appropriate structure and capacities. 


### Mind-Brain Correlation ###

+ We have seen that the behaviorist defines a mental state in terms of physiological responses and bodily movements. They think that such a correlation hold. Others point to a different correlation. 
+ There are correlation between mental phenomena and neural states of the brain. 
+ Examples include injuries, drugs, food. Hit the brain, change the mind. When we engage in various mental activities, parts of the brain light up. 
	+ I should show a video of people with locked in syndrom. or perhaps videos of how we can read minds from reading brains. 
+ I need to say something about neural features.  Various nerve signals cause central neural processes that underlie conscious experiences. 

+ Mind-Brain Correlation Thesis. For each type M of mental event that occurs to an organism o, there exists a brain state of kind B (M’s “neural correlate” or “substrate”) such that M occurs to o at time t if and only if B occurs to o at t.

+ This states a strict correlation between brain states and mental states. Whenever you have a certain type of mental state, you should have a certain type of brain state. Whenever you have a certain kind of brain state, you should have the same kind of mental state. 

+ This is meant to be a law like regularity. It also means that no change in the mind can occur unless there is a change in the brain. 
+ Mind supervenes on the brain. This can be discovered empirically. We can discover whenever pain occurs, certain neural fibers fire. Likewise, when you think of a pink giraffe, different neural fibers. fire. 


## Making sense of Mind-Brain Correlations ##

+ We need to explain property correlations. Let's think of some simple correlations. Some are explained by F causing G. Others are explained by F and G having a common cause, two aspects of the same process. Kim goes through a-f types of correlation and asks how mind and brain are correlated. 
+ Superman and Clark Kent in the same place. 
+   *Causal Interactionism:* Descartes
+   *Presestablished Harmony:* Kind of like clocks with a common historic cause. 
+  *Occasionalism:* A constant intervener. 
+  *Double Aspect Theory:* Two aspects of an underlying substance. They do not cause each other. Spinoza. 
+  *Epiphenomenalism:* Huxley claims that conscious states are caused by neural events in the brain and mental states can do nothing to the brain. 
+  *Emergentism* No explanation for the phenomena. The correlations are brute facts. 
+ *Psychoneural (or Psychophysical, Mind-Body) Identity Theory: mental states are identical to physical processes in the brain 
+ Three arguments for mind-brain identity. Simplicity argument. Causal argument. Explanatory argument. 


### The Argument from Simplicity ###

Occam's razor. Give a more general statement here. Say who Occam was. 14th Century philosophy William of Ocham

+ Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity. 
+ What can be down with fewer assumption should not be done with more. 

Adopt simplest ontology possible. 

Give examples of conspiracy theories. Choose the theory that has the fewest hypotheses and assumptions. 

So, mind-brain identity might explain correlation by satisfying both examples.
