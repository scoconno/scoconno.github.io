\subsection{Late Submissions}\label{late-submissions}

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be
accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you
foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal
or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit
it early.

\subsection{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that
you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and
handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials
than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant
overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against
Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you
include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for
the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a
report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your
permanent academic record.
