## Introduction 

'The Walking Dead' is a piece of science fiction. It depicts a post-apocalyptic future where zombies run amok and a few survivors bandy together for mutual protection. Since fiction often provides such extreme cases, it can be useful to help us clarify the ethical theories that we are discussing this week. We can ask what the ethical thing would be to do in a variety of situations depicted in shows like the Walking Dead. 

In this short [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbn1wELZlB8), Carol, one of the main characters, makes a difficult choice. She kills Lizzie, a girl who Carol had become a mother to. Lizzie has suffered a serious psychiatric break. She considered the zombies to be misunderstood creatures, different from humans, but still alive and entitled to be treated with respect. This belief led Lizzie to risk the lives of those around her. After unsuccessfully trying to help Lizzie, Carol feels forced to kill her after Lizzie decided to turn another girl into a zombie. Watch Lizzie's breakdown [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GitS306EyBQ)


## Prompt

You are a professional ethicist tasked with evaluating Carol's behavior. You give your findings in an oral presentations. Your presentation has three parts:

- Part 1 evaluates her action from the perspective of a consequentialist. 
- Part 2 evaluate her action from the perspective of a deontologist.
- Part 3 evaluates her action from the perspective of a virtue ethicist.

**NB:** By 'evaluating from the perspective of', I mean that you must explain what the relevant ethical theory would say about her action. Would the theory judge it moral or immoral? More importantly, why would it judge it the particular way that it does?  


## Length

Your presentation should be 5-7 minutes long.
