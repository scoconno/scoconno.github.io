**NB: This essay examines your understanding of chapter 2.3 *God and the Problem of Evil***

## Introduction

Your boat!  A terrible hurricane destroyed your fishing boat, your ownly source of income. You paid decent money to insure that boat, but now insurance company is refusing to compensate you, because they claim that hurricanes are 'acts of God' that are not covered by the policy.

What nonsense! You sue the insurance company and argue in court that God does not exist, and so God could not be the cause of the hurricane. Your argument that the existence of evil proves that an all good, all powerful, all knowing God does not exist at all. Thus, the insurance company should compensate you.

## Task

Write the transcript of Ted's closing statement (speech). This should be a word to word report of what he said. 
	+ A closing statement is a speech the lawyer makes to the court. They address the jurors, the judge, the audience. You must write this as a **speech!** Points will be deducted if you do not follow this part of the prompt. 

The transcript must include the following: 

1. A detailed explanation of the 'The Problem of Evil'. Do not use any other argument against or for God's existence. 
2. Your explanation must include what it is for God to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent. 
3. Your explanation must explain why a God with these features would prevent the hurricane. Explain why the fact that the hurricane happened is evidence that no such God exists. 

**NB:** Do not attempt to defend the insurance company. This exercise tests your ability to explain the problem of evil. It is not asking for your personal opinion on the issues.     

## Word Count

Your speech must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.
