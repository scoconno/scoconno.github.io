**NB: This assingment examines your understanding of chapter 2.3 *God and the Problem of Evil***

## Introduction

Your boat!  A terrible hurricane destroyed your fishing boat, your only source of income. You paid decent money to insure that boat, but now the insurance company is refusing to compensate you; they claim that hurricanes are 'acts of God' that are not covered by the policy.

What nonsense! You sue the insurance company and argue in court that God does not exist, and so God could not be the cause of the hurricane. Your argument is that the existence of evil proves that an all good, all powerful, all knowing God does not exist at all. Thus, the insurance company should compensate you.

## Task

Give your closing statement (speech) to the court. Pretend you are really in a court and act out the scene. 

+ A closing statement is a speech the lawyer makes to the court. They address the jurors, the judge, the audience. Y

The speech must include the following: 

1. A detailed explanation of the 'The Problem of Evil'. Do not use any other argument against God's existence. 
2. Your explanation must explain what it is for God to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent. 
3. Your explanation must explain why a God with these features would prevent the hurricane. Explain why the fact that the hurricane happened is evidence that no such God exists. 

**NB:** Do not attempt to defend the insurance company. Do not try refute this argument. This exercise tests your ability to explain the problem of evil. It is not asking for you to find flaws with it.     

## Length

Your speech should be 5-7 minutes long. 



## Format
Lawyers do not use powerpoint presentations in their closing statements. They give a speech! This assignment is asking the same of you. Talk into the camera. Pretend you are talking to the jury and judge.
