## Introduction

Welcome! I'm Dr. Scott O'Connor and I'll be your instructor for this course. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I received a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are ancient philosophy and metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website. 

While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O'Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No 'hey', 'yo', 'what's up', smiley face, etc. See [contact](/Contact) for further information.


## Mechanics

There is a dedicated module for each week. You will find these under 'weeks' in Blackboard. Each week will include an assignments link and a materials link. The materials link will take you to a site that includes the following:  


2. Notes   
3. Readings not contained in the textbook, both optional and required.
5. Media, e.g., video clips, blogs, etc. Some of this is required. Some is optional. Each is clearly marked. 



## Assignments

You will find a full description on the syllabus, but let me emphasize that the syllabus explains: 

1. Assignment due dates. 
2. Late work policies. 

So please read the syllabus! You can find it [here](https://www.scottoconnor.org/examined/Syllabus.pdf).

## Technical Help

All Blackboard activity is recorded. I see when you log on, what you click, and how long you stay on the pages you click. Blackboard outages are rare and are automatically reported to me. If you encounter technical difficulties, the most likely source will be a difficulty with your browser or computer. By taking this course, you are indicating that you have sufficient computer literacy. If at any point, you are uncertain how to use Blackboard or have some technical difficulty, then you should consult NJCU's online learning resources [here.](https://www.njcu.edu/directories/offices-centers/information-technology/help-desk)



## Next Steps 

1. Read the syllabus carefully. Course policies vary by professors, sometimes significantly. You need to understand the policies that govern this course and understand what is required of you.  
2. Complete Week 1.
