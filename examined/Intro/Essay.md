## An e-mail from your future self

### Introduction

Our beliefs and values change over time. Some think that marriage is essential to a flourishing life and then find themselves thinking a solitary life the best. Some think that money is the only thing of value, but come to realize that, for them, family trumps wealth. Some are atheists when they are young but find God later in life. Still others follow the religion of their parents and abandon it when they become adults. You too have changed over time and will continue to do so. 

In this assignment, you will imagine that you have received an email from your future self. They have a surprise in store! You will come to suspect one of your current **political** or **ethical** beliefs. Your older self will explain why they now think that belief is false and encourage you to abandon it.  


### Purpose 

The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others. 

1.  Identifying your own beliefs about important philosophical topics.

2.  Questioning your beliefs as Socrates questioned his own and others. This requires identifying reasons for your beliefs, being honest if you find none, and being courageous enough to change your mind. 



### Task

Write an e-mail from your future self. This email must include the following: 

1. Identify the **political** or **ethical** belief you hold in the present that your older self abandons.   
2. Argue that the **political** or **ethical** belief you currently hold is false, i.e., you must provide reasons for thinking the your current belief is false. 

**NB:** You are writing in the voice of someone from the future. They really think that your current **political** or **ethical** belief is false. So, feel safe in the pretense. You are trying to imagine someone convincing you that your belief is false; you are taking their perspective and temporarily suspending your own.

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
