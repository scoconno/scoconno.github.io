\section{Copyright}
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Catalog Description}

This course teaches students to identify and evaluate those beliefs that guide their thoughts and actions. Reflecting on different sources, students identify those philosophical beliefs that play a role in their own lives. By developing their critical thinking skills, they learn how to clarify, systematize, and assess these beliefs. 

\section{Course Description}

Does God exist? Are you free? Why live? What should you do with your life?  In this course, we'll be asking some of these deep philosophical questions. We begin by discussing the meaning of life, especially why some philosophers have connected a meaningful life with God's existence. This raises the question as to whether God exists. We will examine some classic arguments for the existence of God as well as concerns that God's existence is incompatible with the existence of evil. Many respond to the problem of evil by claiming that evil is a by-product of our free-will, a gift endowed by God to use as we see fit. But are we free? We will discuss why some think our actions are completely pre-determined by causal factors outside of our control. If they are right, free-will is a mere illusion. This raises deep questions about the nature of moral responsibility; can you be held responsible for an action that was out of your control? In the final part of the course, we will ask what determines the moral character of our actions. Do the ends justify the means? After studying the main ethical theories, you will get a chance to work in groups to apply them to a current controversy of your choosing, e.g., the death penalty, euthanasia, abortion, etc. 

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) read philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv) write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of several core philosophical topics, (vi) manage their studies in a responsible and timely manner. 

\section{General Education Information}
