# Optimism about the meaning of life without God


## Introduction 

Recall Tolstoy's question:

>> ... My question - that which at the age of fifty brought me to the verge of suicide - was the simplest of questions, lying in the soul of every man from the foolish child to the wisest elder: it was a question without an answer to which one cannot live, as I had found by experience. It was: "What will come of what I am doing today or shall do tomorrow? What will come of my whole life?" (Tolstoy, p.14)1

[1]: Tolstoy, Leo, `A Confession', 1882

Differently expressed, the question is: "Why should I live, why wish for anything, or do anything?" It can also be expressed thus: "Is there any meaning in my life that the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy? (Tolstoy, p.14)

Life has meaning only if it has significant value or purpose over time, where this value makes life choice worthy. There are two different ways of understanding this value: 

+ **Internal Value:** the value or purpose that comes when people see their goals or purposes as inherently valuable or worthwhile. 
+ **External Value:** Meaning or purpose that comes from outside of ourselves in relationship to something that we may or may not be aware of.

When we ask about the meaning of life, we are asking about internal value. We are asking why we should feel that there is something in our lives that makes them worthwhile. Is there any project or goal that could shape our psychology so dramatically that we are motivated to get up in the morning, keep going, and find all the trials and tribulations of life worthwhile? Pessimists, recall, claim no. Their argument: 

1. Life is choice worthy only if it has internal value. 
2. Life has internal value only if life has external value. 
3. Life has no external value. 
4. Life has no internal value (from 2--3). 
5. Life is not choice worthy (from 1 & 4).

This argument is valid; the conclusion follows form the premises. Is it sound, i.e., are the premises true? The most important Premises are 2 and 3, which we saw Tolstoy arguing for via a fable. We can summarize his argument for Premise 2 as follows: 

- a. I will value some project/goal over a long period of time only if I believe that project/goal is externally valuable. 
- b. I will inevitably discover that my projects/goals have no external value. 
- c. Thus, I will  inevitably cease to value any project/goal. 

Why did Tolstoy accept Premise 3? I suggested that Tolstoy assumes that a goal or project has external value only if that goal contributes towards some eternal enterprise. 




## Optimism

Optimists claim that Tolstoy's arguments for Premises 2 and 3 fail. There are two versions of Optimism. The first version accepts Premises 1 and 2 but rejects Premise 3. They find external value in religion. The second type of Optimist accepts Premise 3, that life has no external value, but denies that internal value depends on there being external value, i.e., they deny Premise 2. The first type of Optimism is associated with Theism and the second with Atheism. I discussed Theism in Note 2. I discuss Atheism in this handout.  


## Atheism

Our second optimistic approach to the meaning of life rejects the need for external value altogether. These optimists ask us to consider the lives of people who clearly lead meaningful lives. If we can identify why we think those lives valuable, we might be able to decide how, we ourselves, can live meaningful lives without external value. 

Who has lived a meaningful life? M.L.K, Gandhi, Einstein, Leonardo Di Vinci are clear candidates. Can we see anything similar to their lives? Here are two candidates: 

+ **Candidate 1:** A person's life is meaningful if and only if their life makes them happy. 

Candidate 1 is an obvious suggestion. Maybe you can live a meaningful life by just living a happy life.

The difficulty with Candidate 1 is that there are many obvious cases of people who lived meaningful but unhappy lives. Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Einstein, for example, were not happy, but they lived meaningful lives. Additionally, obvious cases of meaningless lives are filled with a good amount of subjective happiness and contentedness. So happiness doesn't make a life meaningful. As an example, watch this video about the experience machine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ1dsNauhGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ1dsNauhGE)

Susan Wolf has offered the following alternative account:

[^2]: 'The Meaning of Lives', Susan Wolf 

+ **Candidate 2:** A meaningful life is one that is a) actively and at least somewhat b) successfully engaged in a project (or projects) of c) positive value.[^2]

Wolf's account has three distinct conditions. She argues for each by contrasting meaningful and meaningless lives. Her example of a meaningless life is 'The Blob', a person who spends every moment in front of a television set, drinking beer and watching situation comedies. Compare the Blob to the life of Iran Deckard in Phillip Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*, or the soma consuming citizens of Aldous Huxley's, *A  Brave New World*, or the television watchers of Ray Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*, or the citizens of The Capitol in Suzanne Collins' *The Hunger Games*. These are all examples of people who live lives that are subjectively pleasant but, nevertheless,  meaningless.


### A active vs. non-active life

Consider people whose lives are useless due to a lack of activity: the Blob sitting on the sofa day in, day out, drinking beer and watching terrible television. That life is meaningless, according to Wolf, precisely because of its lack of activity. We might also consider the lives of the idle rich, lives filled with great distraction but no direction. It is not surprising that children born into such families often suffer depression, drug addition, and other afflictions. 

Wolf asks us to conclude with her that a meaningful life must be one actively engaged in some project, where these projects are any kind of ongoing activity or involvement. The projects engage the person, who see them as constituting part of what their life is about and they pursue them with zest. Not every activity in your life will be organized around this project, but Wolf does think that even the mundane activities of life will be approached with greater zest if you are pursuing an overarching goal, e.g., the doctor devoting her life to eradicating cancer will find laundry, grocery shopping, and all the other menial tasks of life just less of a task. They will approach them with energy, quickly dispatching what needs to be done so they can return to their true pursuit.


### Success vs. non-Success

Consider cases in which the project around which somebody has organized their life is revealed to be bankrupt, e.g., the inventor who devotes their life to creating an automated car only to be beaten to the punch by Google.  Or the CEO who spends a life developing a business that is superseded by new technologies, e.g., the CEO of a nuclear power plant company that ends up seeing nuclear power replaced by solar power. Or a person who must use all their might to roll a heavy rock to the top of a hill only for it to roll back as soon as it reaches the summit. 
These lives are clearly tragic. There's something miserable about devoting your life to a project that never sees fruition. There are different reasons why you might not be complete a project: 

1. The project can be completed, but it is impossible for *you* to do so. 
2. The project, in principle, cannot be completed, not just for you but also for anyone who attempts it.

The lives of M.L.K, Gandhi, Mandela were clearly meaningful. They not only single-mindedly pursued some project, they were successful in their pursuits. So too were those athletes who spent every waking moment not only training for the olympics but also securing a place and doing well. (Compare this to, say, the person who trains all day to compete for the Olympic track team but has never and will never run a mile in less than 10 minutes)

These cases show us that for a life to be meaningful it must be organized around some project that the person succeeds at, or has a reasonable chance of succeeding at, or, at the very least, whose efforts ensure that the project can at some point be realized.  


### Projects of Positive Value

Consider cases in which a life, though actively engaged, is wasted on a project without any positive value. Someone might decide to adopt as their life project the task of counting the number of grains of sand on Sandy Hook beach. Another person might decide to devote their life to chewing hay for a horse with bad teeth. Yet another might be devoted to advertising a nail salon for small dogs while dressed as a poodle on the sidewalk. These projects energize the person; they actively pursue them. Furthermore, the person might succeed at these projects. Nevertheless, a life devoted to such works seems utterly worthless. 

Wolf concludes from this that a meaningful life must be one dedicated to project of some positive value.

> What is clear to me is that  there can be no sense to the idea of meaningfulness without a distinction between more and less worthwhile ways to spend one’s time, where the test of worth is at least partly independent of a subject’s ungrounded preferences or enjoyment.


## Objection

The Atheist claims that life can have internal value without external value. Wolf's defense of this claim relies on the claim that a life must be devoted to a project of positive value. That is, it is not enough that you value a project, the project itself must be of some genuine positive value. It seems we are back where we started. Tolstoy worried that since he and everyone else will ultimately die, none of his goals and accomplishments were of any external value. But we can re-phrase his worry in terms of positive value: can any project I pursue have positive value given that I will disappear along with all of my accomplishments into nothing whatsoever? In order to answer this question,  Wolf owes us an account of external value that is compatible with our mortality.


## Meaning re-considered

We are at an impasse. Atheists think we can do without external meaning, but it is unclear that we can distinguish worthwhile lives from worthless lives without it. Theists, on the other hand, are convinced that life has external meaning, but they struggle to give a satisfying account of what that meaning is. Is there an alternative? 

One option is to re-consider Epicureanism, an option towards death that Tolstoy rejects. 

+ Epicureanism: while knowing the hopelessness of life, make use meanwhile of the advantages one has, disregarding the dragon and the mice, and licking the honey in the best way, especially if there is much of it within reach. This, though, is an unsustainable attitude. Many live in terrible conditions. Many have no honey to taste. It is a mere accident, claims Tolstoy, that you have good circumstances rather than poor, and ''the accident that has today made me a Solomon may tomorrow make me a Solomon's slave.'' Epicureans try but cannot ultimately forget that all these pleasures are ephemeral. They are as easily lost as gained. Nobody can be confident that life will always provide these distractions. 

Tolstoy assumes that the only pleasures in life are ephemeral, that the only things we can desire are those that ultimately will cause us pain. Buddha would agree that desiring the ephemeral is a cause of pain, but is Tolstoy right that we can *only* desire the ephemeral? Are there things we could desire and become attached to that are permanent or at least easily accessible? (Read *Buddhism* in ch.2 for Buddha's views on how desires can be changed and their pain lessened.)
