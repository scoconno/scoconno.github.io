## Introduction

Flex your imagination. You are a dragon living in a comfortable well, which strangers sometimes fall down when they are not watching their path ahead. One day, a particularly plump academic type falls down below. Unfortunately for you, your potential dinner grabs onto some tree roots sticking out of the well wall. So frustrating! He also seems to love honey, which is annoying given that some honey is trickling down those roots. You wish he would hurry up. Of course, the roots will break when your allies, those mice, nibble through them. But that takes too long. You are hungry now! So, you try to persuade the victim to drop below to your waiting jaws. 

## Task

Pretending to be the dragon, use Tolstoy's argument that life is meaningless to convince the person clinging to the wall to let go. Your submission must include the following:

+ You must explain Tolstoy's argument that life is meaningless. 
+ This explanation must include a discussion of the difference between internal and external value. 
+ You should not repeat the examples from the textbook and notes; develop your own examples. 
+ You should submit an original presentation and discussion of the argument. Don't just read from the textbook or notes.  

**NB:** Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will lose you points. 


## Length

Presentations should be c.5 minutes long. Feel free to use animations, slides, etc., in your video. But really embrace the idea that you are that dragon
