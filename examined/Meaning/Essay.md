### Introduction

Flex your imagination. You are a dragon living in a comfortable well. It's not that obvious a well and strangers sometimes fall down it when they are not watching the path ahead. The well is also nice and slippy; you have yet to see anyone climb up who has fallen down. One day, a particularly plumb and tasty academic type falls down below. Unfortunately for you, there are some roots of a tree sticking out of the well walls and this potential dinner grabs onto the wall. So frustrating! He also seems to love honey, which is annoying given that some honey is trickling down those roots. You wish he would hurry up. Of course, the roots will break when your allies, those mice, nibble through the roots. But that takes too long. You are hungry now! So, you try to persuade the victim to drop below to your waiting jaws. 

### Task

Write a dialogue between you and the well hanger. Your dialogue must contain the following elements:

+ The dragon must explain Tolstoy's argument that life is meaningless. 
+ This explanation must include a discussion of the difference between internal and external value. 

**NB:** Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will lose you points. 




### Word Count

Your dialog must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.

### Further Instruction

+ This assignment covers material contained in Ch.9.1--9.3.
+ Note that this is a dialog. Imagine the way dialogs go. There is some back and forth. There is humor. There are jibes. Characters have names. Write your dialog accordingly. See any play for some ideas on format. 
+ Allow your characters to question each other, rebut each other, etc.
   



### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

### Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.
