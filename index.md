# Welcome 

Welcome! I am the Assistant Provost for Academic Programming at [New Jersey City University](www.njcu.edu), where I lead strategic initiatives to strengthen partnerships with community colleges, high schools, and other institutions. My work focuses on curricular reform to expand access to higher education, streamline transfer pathways, and enhance program development to align with institutional and student needs.

I spearhead NJCU’s efforts to put transfer students first, leading the rapid expansion of the NJCU-HCCC Connect Program and successfully negotiating institutional partnerships with Mercer County Community College and Essex County College. Beyond community colleges, I have also refocused NJCU’s honors and international recruitment efforts on transfer enrollment. Additionally, I oversee key academic programs and offices, ensuring the effective delivery and continuous improvement of our curriculum.

Before transitioning into academic administration, I was an associate professor of philosophy, specializing in ancient Greek philosophy, with a particular focus on Aristotle’s metaphysics and natural philosophy. I also served as General Education Director from 2021 to 2023, leading a major revision of NJCU’s Gen Ed program to improve student outcomes and make NJCU the most transfer friendly institution in state of NJ. You can read more about that [here](GE.pdf) and in [ROI-NJ](https://www.roi-nj.com/2023/05/03/education/njcu-takes-1st-step-in-recovery-plan-school-making-it-easier-to-obtain-transfer-credits/).

I earned my PhD in philosophy from Cornell University, following a BPhil from Oxford University and a BA from Trinity College, Dublin.
