I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [New Jersey City University](http:\\www.njcu.edu) specializing in ancient and contemporary metaphysics. My current research focuses on identifying and characterizing Aristotle's views on persistence. I am also working on the metaphysics of Aristotelian matter. You can find my Curriculum Vitae [here](about/CV.pdf).
