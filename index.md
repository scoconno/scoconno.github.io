# Welcome 

I am an assistant professor in the philosophy department at [New Jersey City University](http://www.njcu.edu). I specialize in  ancient Greek philosophy, especially in Aristotle's metaphysics and natural philosophy. You can find links to my research [here](research) and my CV [here](CV.pdf). 

I received my PhD from [Cornell University](http://philosophy.cornell.edu) in 2013, where I was advised by Gail Fine, Terence Irwin, and Theodore Brennan. Before Cornell, I received my BPhil from [Oxford University](https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/home) and my BA from [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Philosophy/).
