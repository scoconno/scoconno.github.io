# Welcome 

Welcome! I am the Assistant Provost for Academic Programming at [New Jersey City University[(www.njcu.edu), where I oversee strategic partnerships with community colleges, high schools, and other educational institutions. My responsibilities also include the management of our program development, improvement, and delivery processes, in addition to supervising various programs and university offices.

Prior to joining the Provost's Office, I was an associate professor in the philosophy department, focusing on  ancient Greek philosophy, especially in Aristotle's metaphysics and natural philosophy. You can find links to my research [here](research) and my CV [here](CV.pdf). Additionally, I served as General Education Director from 2021 to 2023, during which time I led a significant revision of the program. You can read more about that[here](GE.pdf) and [here](https://www.roi-nj.com/2023/05/03/education/njcu-takes-1st-step-in-recovery-plan-school-making-it-easier-to-obtain-transfer-credits/).

I received my PhD from [Cornell University](http://philosophy.cornell.edu). Before Cornell, I received my BPhil from [Oxford University](https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/home) and my BA from [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Philosophy/).
