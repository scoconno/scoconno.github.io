# Welcome 

I am an assistant professor of philosophy at [New Jersey City University](http://www.njcu.edu) specializing in ancient and contemporary metaphysics. My current research focuses on identifying and characterizing Aristotle's views about persistence. I am also working on the metaphysics of Aristotelian matter. You can find my curriculum vitae [here](about/CV.pdf).
