# Welcome 

Welcome! I am the Assistant Provost for Academic Programming at [New Jersey City University](www.njcu.edu), where I lead strategic initiatives that strengthen partnerships with community colleges, high schools, and other institutions. My work focuses on curricular driven reform to expand access to higher education, streamlining transfer pathways, and enhancing program development to align with institutional and student needs. I spearhead NJCU’s reform efforts to place transfer students first in everything we do. I led the rapid expansion of the NJCU HCCC Connect Program and successfully negotiated institutional partnerships betweeen NJCU and Mercer County Community College, and NJCU and Essex County College. In addition to our focus on Community Colleges, I have led NJCU in refocusing honors and international recruitment on transfer enrollment. I also oversee key academic programs and offices, ensuring the effective delivery and continuous improvement of our curriculum.

Before transitioning into academic administration, I was an associate professor of philosophy, specializing in ancient Greek philosophy, with a particular focus on Aristotle’s metaphysics and natural philosophy. My research is available here, and my CV can be found here. I also served as General Education Director from 2021 to 2023, leading a major revision of NJCU’s Gen Ed program to improve student outcomes and make NJCU the most transfer friendly institution in state of NJ. You can read more about that [here](GE.pdf) and in [ROI-NJ]((https://www.roi-nj.com/2023/05/03/education/njcu-takes-1st-step-in-recovery-plan-school-making-it-easier-to-obtain-transfer-credits/).
