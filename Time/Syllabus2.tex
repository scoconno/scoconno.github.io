\section{Disclaimer}
 This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the faculty. Students will be notified of such changes ahead of time via Blackboard. 


\section{Copyright}
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Catalog Description}
The measuring of time is both essential to us and the societies we live in. But what exactly is it that we are measuring? This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary study of time. Readings will be drawn from historical and contemporary work in the social and natural sciences, philosophy, and literature.

\section{Course Description}
Students will be introduced to the study of time by studying its nature and the role it plays in our lives and societies more generally. Readings will be drawn from a variety of disciplines: history, classics, sociology, literature, philosophy, physics, and psychology. Each student will focus for a significant part of the course on a capstone project in which he or she will undertake study in the modes of inquiry that best reflect his or her academic interests and are most appropriate for the chosen capstone project. 





\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) find the argument of a text and clearly restate it, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that are not their own, (iii) think critically, (iv) write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate a substantive grasp of how time is an  important topic of study in several distinct disciplines. 

\section{General Education Information} 
Successfully completing this course satisfies one Tier 3 capstone requirement. For further information about the General Education Program see \href{http://njcu.edu/department/general-education}{http://njcu.edu/department/general-education}.
