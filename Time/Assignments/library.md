## Introduction

Our library session introduced us to databases, search techniques, bibliographical tools, and more. In this assignment, we will practice those skills needed for your capstone project later in this course. We will use the history of some time-keeping device as a sample topic. 

## Task

Pick any time-piece as your sample watch. It could be a sundial, a water clock, an atomic clock, or any other of the many clocks that humans have used to track the passing of time. Suppose that you were to write a research paper about your chosen clock. You would first need to find suitable research material. 

1. Find three relevant full text **articles** in the library databases on your chosen clock. These articles must be **peer reviewed**.
2. Write a full bibliographic record for each article.  
2. Write a brief annotation for each article. The annotation should include 1) a description of the type of source, e.g., information about the author, the journal the article appears in, etc., 2) a short summary of how the article relates to your chosen topic--read just enough to figure out the general point of the article. 

**NB:** Failure to include any of these elements in your submission will result in a loss of points. 

## Word Count

Each annotation should be 100--200 words. Your submission should be 300--600 total.  

## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

## Format
Please submit the file as a docx or pdf.
