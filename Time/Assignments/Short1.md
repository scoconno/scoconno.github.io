## Short Essay 1

### Prompt 

Suppose that you are giving a short lesson to 6th graders on time. Explain to them why it is so difficult to test whether a timepiece is 100 percent accurate. Explain to them why this leaves open the question whether one event really is longer than a subsequent event.

 
### Further Instruction

+ Write in very simple English prose. These are kids. 
+ Use vivid examples. You can include pictures if you like.
