Special relativity: interstellar form about 1 hour. They talk about 7 hours passing on that planet for eveyrone one hour that passes on Earth. 



Two postulates for special relativity

INERTIAL REFERENCE FRAME

An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force.

FIRST POSTULATE OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY

The laws of physics are the same and can be stated in their simplest form in all inertial frames of reference.

(only tell you are moving relative). If I'm on a boat that's moving, I can't measure my motion to the boat's motion. 

Now then, from his experiments, Galileo deduced that two observers moving at a constant velocity will get the same results from all mechanical experiments. To make it easier to understand, think of it like this: being inside of a vehicle that is traveling at a constant velocity is the same as being inside a vehicle that is at rest (velocity = 0). To prove this, look at where you are right now. You may think that you are at rest, but the Earth is actually moving at an approximately constant velocity through space around the Sun. You don’t feel a thing while sitting there and reading this, and there is no experiment that you can do here on Earth to determine the Earth’s speed.

Hence, one phrase that is important in relativity is the “reference frame.” In relativity, velocity is not absolute, but rather, velocity depends on where you are making the observation. The point at which you are making your observation is where your reference frame is. A reference frame that is moving at a uniform velocity is called an “inertial reference frame.” Ultimately, Galilean relativity can be summarized by saying that all mechanical laws of physics are valid in inertial reference frames. 

. It can be best understood with this example: you are on a vehicle travelling at 10m/s, then you throw a ball forward at 10m/s. An outside observer will then see the ball to have a velocity of 20m/s. If you threw the ball backwards, the outside observer will then see the ball to have a velocity of 0 i.e., it will appear to stop.

When I look at X, I ask how far did the speed of light travel. 

Two mirrors. The light on my rocket bounces up and then back down to a detector. If we add all the lengths it travels it gets to say, 4 x 10cm. Now, if you observe from Earth and see inside my rocket. Apparently I won't see the light going straight up and down. I'll see it going at an angle. 

Same velocity 

Well, since she is going faster than me, and my light is travelling the same distance as hers, then light must have travelled further for her than it did for me. 


V=m/s

V=100/2

V=200/4

Same velocity, different distance, so it must be different time. From my perspective, you were travelling for 4 seconds, but from your perspective, you were traveling 

SECOND POSTULATE OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY

The speed of light c is a constant, independent of the relative motion of the source.


The second postulate states that: “the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial reference frames.” It simply means that, wherever you look from, you will measure the same speed of light in a vacuum (as long as it moves at a constant velocity). At first, this doesn’t sound so amazing, but when you think of it, it is. For example, if you are in a spaceship travelling at the speed of light and you fire a laser up front, Galilean relativity’s addition of velocities tells us that an observer outside the spaceship will see the laser at twice the speed of light, but Einstein tells us that the observer will still see light travel at light speed. How is that possible? The constancy of the speed of light has two consequences that make it possible, namely, length contraction & time dilation.

Length contraction is the shortening of length of an object travelling at relativistic speeds (speeds that are near the speed of light) relative to an observer outside the object.

Time dilation, on the other hand, is the slowing down of time at an object moving at relativistic speeds. This is described in the twin paradox. The paradox starts with two twins who are (of course) the same age. One of the twins (twin A) rode a spaceship that travels at relativistic speeds to some distant place. After traveling for some time, twin A returns again at the same speed. Because twin A moved at relativistic speeds, he would be younger than twin B when he comes home (twin A would have experienced a slowing down of time).
