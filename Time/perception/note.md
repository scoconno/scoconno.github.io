## Our Experience of Time

How is it possible for us to have experiences as of temporally unified events given that we seem only able to experience a sequence of independent and static snapshots of the world? John Locke denied that we have these experiences: 

> … the Body, though it really moves, … [nevertheless] seems to stand still, as is evident in the Hands of Clocks, and Shadows of Sun-dials, and other constant, but slow Motions, where though after certain Intervals, we perceive by the change of distance, that it hath moved, yet the Motion itself we perceive not. ( John Locke, *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*, Book II, chapter XIV, §11.)



But it certainly seems like we can experience time: 

>  [I]t is a notorious fact that we do not merely notice that something *has* moved or otherwise changed; we also often see something *moving* or *changing*. This happens if we look at the second-hand of a watch or look at a flickering flame. These are experiences of a quite unique kind; we could no more describe what we sense in them to a man who had never had such experiences than we could describe a red colour to a man born blind. It is also clear that to see a second-hand *moving* is a quite different thing from “seeing” that an hour-hand *has* moved.  C. D. Broad, *Scientific Thought*, p. 351.





Our experience of time has several features: 

1. We experience various events in a particular order, e.g., we experience one event as occurring before a different event. Some believe that the time we experience an event as occurring at is determined by the time the correlated brain process occurs. Others claim it is not determined by the time the correlated brain process occurs, but in terms of some other feature of the brain processes. 
2. We experience some events as as simultaneous, even if they are not simultaneous. This is especially problematic as we may experience events 1 and 2 as simultaneous with one another, 2 and 3 as simultaneous with another, but 1 and 3 as not simultaneous with one another. This shows that experience of simultaneity is far removed from what, in fact, simultaneity really is. 
3. We experience events to occur not merely at times but also through time, e.g., I experience some events as occurring slower than others.  



##Two Possible Answers



*Specious Present Theory*: 

: We directly perceive temporally extended events, e.g., we perceive more than just the exact present. On this view, we don't merely experience snap shots of reality. 



*Retention Theory*: 

: Experience of reality is supplemented with memories from the past and anticipations of the future. The content of experience is not merely exhausted by the world we experience but also includes content, somehow, from us. 



### Spacious Present



How long is the present you experience? 



>  [T]he practically cognized present is no knife-edge, but a saddle-back, with a certain breadth of its own on which we sit perched, and from which we look in two directions into time. The unit of composition of our perception of time is a *duration*, with a bow and a stern, as it were – a rearward- and a forward-looking end... We do not first feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the perception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we seem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends embedded in it. (William James, *The Principles of Psychology*, Vol. I, pp. 609-10.)



According to James, we perceive not only what is **now** occurring but also with what **has recently occurred** and what is **about to occur** as well. It lasts less than 3 seconds. 



**Problems**

1. How can I be directly aware of something that is no longer taking place?
2. How can I be directly aware of a duration?
3. How can I be directly aware of the future?



### Retention Theory



Often defended by empiricists, who were interested in the origin of our ideas. My origin of a cat comes from seeing cats. Other ideas are not from experience of the world but from association of these ideas. Succession and duration are meant to be like this. 

> The idea of time is not deriv’d from a particular impression mix’d up with others, and plainly distinguishable from them; but arises altogether from the manner, in which impressions appear to the mind, without making one of the number. Five notes play’d on a flute give us the impression and idea of time; tho’ time be not a sixth impression, which presents itself to the hearing or any other of the senses. (Hume, *Treatise*, pp. 34-5.)



Empiricists claim that we get the idea of succession, of one thing following another, by just having a succession of ideas. But: 

> “A succession of feelings, in and of itself, is not a feeling of succession.” (William James, *Principles*)



Kant's alternative: every moment I not only have an experience of the thing before me now, but I also “reproduce in imagination” the things I experienced in the recent past. Unlike James, Kant does not claim we perceive the past or the future. He rather claims that we somehow reproduce them in imagination, e.g., remember the past. 



Others accept that we have some cognitive reproduction of the past, but they don't want to characterize this as memory.
