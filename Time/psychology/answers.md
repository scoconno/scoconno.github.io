**Exercise 5.1**

In our report, we demonstrate Abco's advantages over its competitors by  highlighting the components of its profitability, particularly growth in Asian markets. We base this analysis on revenue returns according to product type, end-use, distribution channels, etc. We project that development of distribution channels in China will be important for Abco's newest product lines. Their introduction of new products must also be supported by a range of innovative strategies.

Animals of the same species communicate a limited repertoire of messages in the same way.
