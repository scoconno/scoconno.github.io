title: Exploratory essay

## Introduction

We are trying to develop the traits of independent researchers. To that end, you will complete an independent project over the remainder of the semester.  We will scaffold that project around a few assignments:  

1. An exploratory essay.
2. Draft 1 focusing on the literature review.
3. Oral presentation.
4. Final draft. 

Please see the syllabus for the relevant due dates. 


## Exploratory Essay--SUBMIT
In this first part of the project, you will write an exploratory essay. This must have the following three parts.

1. State your research question about time. If you wish to write on a topic not included in the list of possible capstones projects, you must seek my approval first. 
2. Write 400-600 words on background information to to your question.
3. Write the bibliographic record for 3-5 academic sources that deals with your topic. 

## Further Information on Task 2

The second task asks you to provide context and background to your question. This context provides sufficient details to your reader to help them see why your question is an interesting one. Or to put it differently, it provides enough detail to explain why your question does not have an obvious answer and is something that requires further research and study. Suppose you encounter this question: 

+ Does Socrates claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Suppose further you have never heard of Socrates. You would be so unanchored that you wouldn't even know the relevant area the question concerned. You definitely wouldn't know enough to care about answering that question. Now suppose that the author prefaced their question with the following: 

> Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher, is famous for claiming that he is wise because he does not take himself to know what he does not know. But he doesn't explain what wisdom amounts to. The very little he says seems to leave open the possibility that a person who knew nothing at all could be wise. As long as they didn't claim to have knowledge, they would be wise. But lots of thing satisfy this description. My cat does. She doesn't claim to have knowledge. Does that make her wise? It does from a simple reading of Socrates' claim. 
>
> So, we want to take a closer look at Socrates' account of wisdom. Perhaps he believes that the wise person is not merely silent about their lack of knowledge but is also aware of that lack. That kind of awareness is not something my cat possesses. But if this isn't the relevant addition, is there anything else to Socrates' account of wisdom that would avoid the conclusion that my cat is wise? 
>
> Interpreters defend various views. One says..
>
> 

When we provide our readers sufficient context like this, they understand what we want to write about, and they often want to read what we have to say. So, for this assignment, you will write the context and background for your question. If writing about the big bang, tell your readers what the big bang is and explain why it forces us to puzzle over whether time has a beginning. You won't solve the puzzle yet. You'll do that later in the semester. But you will write enough to convince your reader that your puzzle is worthy of their attention.
