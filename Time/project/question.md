## Introduction

Our goals is develop the traits of independent researchers. To that end, you will complete an independent project over the remainder of the semester.  But we will scaffold that project around a few basic skills (and tasks to practice those skills).

1. A manageable and interesting research proposal.
2. Annotated bibliography.
3. Literature review
3. Oral presentation.
4. Final draft. 


## Research Question 

### The form of a question

In our first stage, you will clearly articulate some question about **time** you wish to answer this semester. And I mean **question**. Questions are formed with an interrogative like the following: 

+ *which*, *what*
+ *how*
+ *why*
+ *who*, *whom*, *whose* 
+ *when*
+ *when*
+ *does*

So *what* question about time would you like to answer this semester? 

###A manageable question

Research projects vary in scope and ambition. Some ask narrowly defined questions and can be completed in a few months. Others ask large questions that take years to address. Your question must fall in the former category. So, compare the following two questions:

1. How do humans measure time?  
2. Why is cesium a good element to use in an atomic clock? 

Our first question would require you to examine every clock humans have created for measuring time. It would require you to give, in effect, a full history of time measurement. That's a huge project, and it would take an entire book to  complete it successfully. The second question is manageable and could be completed in a couple of months. It requires you to discuss what it means for a clock to be accurate, explain how atomic clocks work, and discuss the features of cesium that makes it a good choice for such a clock. It doesn't require a full discussion of cesium, but it requires that you say enough to answer the question. 

I hope it's obvious how these two differ!

## Task

You must complete the following three tasks for your proposal:  

1. State your question about time. You must use an interrogative. I also expect to see a question mark. 
2. Write a short paragraph that motivates your question.
1. Write the references for 3 peer reviewed sources that deals with your topic. 

## Further Information 

The first tasks asks you to identify a manageable project about time. It is essential that your question is about time. Some reference to time in the question does not suffice. Compare these two questions: 

1. Can everyone run a four minute mile? 
2. How did changes in time-keeping affect the sport of track and field? 

The first question mentions time, but it's hardly a project about time. The second question is better. It is a question that requires some investigation into different clocks, into how humans used them in a sporting competition, and into how and why the development of clocks shaped that sport. 

The second task might confuse you, so let me explain it further. The idea is that you want to provide some context and background to your question. The context provides sufficient details to your reader to help them see why your question is an interesting one. Or to put it differently, it provides enough detail to explain why your question does not have an obvious answer and is something that requires further research and study. Suppose you encounter this question: 

+ Does Socrates claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Suppose further you have never heard of Socrates or the *Apology*. You would be so unanchored that you wouldn't even know the relevant area the question concerned. You definitely wouldn't know enough to care about answering that question. But, imagine that you the author first wrote this question: 

> Socrates, an ancient Greek philosophy, is famous for claiming that he is wise because he does not take himself to know what he does not know. But he doesn't explain what wisdom amounts to. The very little he says seems to leave open the possibility that a person who knew nothing at all could be wise. As long as they didn't claim to have knowledge, they would be wise. But lots of thing satisfy this description. My cat does. She doesn't claim to have knowledge. Does that make her wise? It does from a simple reading of Socrates' claim. So, we want to take a closer look at Socrates' account of wisdom. Perhaps, he believes that the wise person not only is aware of the knowledge they do not possess, but they also have the capacity and desire to obtain knowledge. That's not something my cat possesses. If this isn't the relevant addition, is there anything else to Socrates' account of wisdom that would avoid the conclusion that my cat is wise? 

The third task asks you to identify three peer reviewed sources for your paper. Remember, a peer reviewed source is an academic source. You can't use newspapers, or blogs, or quora. This tasks is work. It takes time and effort. You may need to ask for help from a librarian. In future assignments, I will be asking you to read this sources and write about them. If you don't use peer reviewed sources, you will unlikely pass the capstone and this course.
