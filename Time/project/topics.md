This is a general education capstone course on Time. Students will develop a research topic on time and complete it through a series of scaffolding assignments throughout the semester. 

I want students to learn how to find research material for their independent projects. They can only use peer reviewed, scholarly, materials. So, I want for us to explain what that is and also teach them how to find relevant material.
