## Presentations

Great progress! You have a question. You have identified several sources that are relevant to that question. You have explained the background to your questions and sketched out some standard answers in the literature. Congratulate yourself on how much progress you have already made. 

Now that you have surveyed the literature, it is time for you to form your own opinion on the question. Do you think one of the answers that has been defended is correct? If so, why that one as opposed to another? Do you think there is an ignored alternative? Now is the time for you to advance the conversation. 

I hope that you are beginning to realize that research is a very gradual process. Forming your own views is also a gradual process. Researchers don't come up with something new overnight. They take the germ of an idea, mull over it, talk about it with peers and colleagues, and then slowly develop it. 

Your presentation provides you the opportunity to formulate your views before writing your final paper. Researchers often do present their findings at conferences before publishing them. So too you will be presenting to your colleagues your views on your topic. 

Since you might not have given a presentation before, I am going to give you very structured instructions.  

## Task

Compose 6-8 slides. Each slide should contain a striking picture, or quote, or graph, or other visual cue. It can include bullet points of some important claim, but you should minimize the amount of text on the slides. You will be using your slides as cues---do not put the entire text on the slide. The 6 slides must be written as follows (each number corresponds to a slide): 

+ Slide 1: Relevant background on your topic.
+ Slide 2: Question raised. 
+ Slide 3. Answer 1 explained.
+ Slide 4: Answer 2 explained. 
* Slide 5: Your answer. 
+ Slides 6-7: Evidence/support/argument for your answer.
+ Slide 8: Conclusion. 


## Further instruction 

+ Time limit: 6-8 minutes for the presentation. 2-4 minutes for Q&A.
