## The Beginning of Time 

![image](ussher.gif)

James Ussher (1580-1655) asked when the Universe was created. His answer: 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 22, 4004 B.C. How did he get that date? 

+ Looking at a variety of ancient texts, he discovered that King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon died in 562 B.C. 
+ Going through the Old Testament, he added the ages of the prophets and the reigns of the kings that came before Nebuchadnezzar. He decide that was 3,442 years. 
+ 3,442 years before 562 BD gets us to 4004 B.C. 
+ Ussher notes that he apples were ripe in the Garden of Eden, , so it must have been fall. He suggested the autumn equinox as likely. 
+ *Genesis* suggests each day began in the evening, so he believed the world was created in the evening.

Does the beginning and end of the universe imply the beginning and end of time itself?

Arguments that time had no beginning {#arguments-that-time-had-no-beginning .unnumbered}
====================================

From the nature of beginning {#from-the-nature-of-beginning .unnumbered}
----------------------------

Events have beginnings and endings in time. A beginning implies a
change. If Bob begins to exist, then there was a time when he did not
exist and a later time when he did exist. So a beginning to time
suggests that time changed from not-existing to existing.

From the first moment {#from-the-first-moment .unnumbered}
---------------------

It seems that time has a beginning if there was a first moment, or, if
the past is finite in extent.

-   Every moment is (at some time) present.

-   The present is the boundary between past and future.

-   If there was a first moment of time, it could not have been
    present - because there can be no past at the beginning of time
    (from P2).

-   There was no first moment of time (from P1 & P3).

-   Time has no beginning (from P4).

PSR {#psr .unnumbered}
---

*The Principle of Sufficient Reason* (PSR) requires that every state of
the universe has an antecedent cause that explains it. Hence, the
universe and time should have no beginning.

1.  Flesh out the argument.

2.  Possible rebuttals?

Time cannot have a beginning {#time-cannot-have-a-beginning .unnumbered}
============================

-   If time had no beginning, then an infinite amount of time has
    already passed.

-   If an infinite amount of time has passed, then it is possible for an
    infinite series to be completed,

-   It is not possible for an infinite series to be completed.

-   An infinite amount of time has not passed (from P1--P3).

-   Time had a beginning.

<!-- -->

-   Can an infinite series have no beginning or last member?

-   Suppose that time is an infinite series with no first member. Then
    there must be some series of states that has no beginning. The
    causal explanation goes on forever.

A Dilemma {#a-dilemma .unnumbered}
=========

-   If time has a beginning, but no end, then there is an uncaused
    event, namely, the beginning of the universe.

-   If time does not have a beginning, then the past extends
    indefinitely and there is no finite explanation of the existence of
    any stage in the universe's history.
