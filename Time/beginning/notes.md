## The Beginning of Time 

![image](ussher.gif)

James Ussher (1580-1655) asked when the Universe was created. His answer: 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 22, 4004 B.C. How did he get that date? 

+ Looking at a variety of ancient texts, he discovered that King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon died in 562 B.C. 
+ Going through the Old Testament, he added the ages of the prophets and the reigns of the kings that came before Nebuchadnezzar. He decide that was 3,442 years. 
+ 3,442 years before 562 BD gets us to 4004 B.C. 
+ Ussher notes that he apples were ripe in the Garden of Eden, , so it must have been fall. He suggested the autumn equinox as likely. 
+ *Genesis* suggests each day began in the evening, so he believed the world was created in the evening.

But, we now believe that the universe is 13.7 billion years old!

## The Beginning of Time? 

Does the beginning (and end of) the universe imply the beginning (and end of) time itself? Should a theist accept that God existed before his act of creation? Should we accept that some period of time existed before the big bang, that the singularity existed for a period of time before the big bang occurred? Recall that an Absolutist about time believes that time exists independently of any process or change. The relationalist denies this. Deciding whether time existed before the universe began, may help decide this debate. 

## Arguments that time had no beginning 

### From the nature of beginning 

2. If Bob began to exist, then there was one time when he did not exist and a later time when he did exist. 
3. If time began to exist, then there was one time when time did not exist and a later time when time did exist. 
4. It is contradictory to claim that there was a time when time did not exist. 
5. Therefore, time could not have had a beginning. 

### From the first moment 

Time has a beginning if there was a first moment of time. This argument shows that this is impossible. 

1. Every moment is (at some time) present.
2. The present is the boundary between past and future.
3. If there was a first moment of time, it could not have been present--because there can be no past at the beginning of time  (from 2).
4. There was no first moment of time (from 1 & 3).
5. Time has no beginning (from P4).

### The Principe of Sufficient Reading

*The Principle of Sufficient Reason:* states that for everything that occurs at a given moment, there is always an explanation, a cause, of why it occurred at precisely that moment and not at some other moment. In general, if event x causes event y, then x occurs some time before y occurs.

1.  Student task: how might this principle be used to argue that time has no beginning? 
2.  Possible rebuttals?

## Argument that time has a beginning 

1. If time had no beginning, then an infinite amount of time has already passed.
2. If an infinite amount of time has passed, then it is possible for an infinite series to be completed,
3. It is not possible for an infinite series to be completed.
4. An infinite amount of time has not passed (from 1--3).
5. Therefore, time had a beginning.

Questions: 

-   Can an infinite series have no beginning or last member?
-   Suppose that time is an infinite series with no first member. Then there must be some series of states that has no beginning. The causal explanation goes on forever.
