## Essay 2: The Republic

Below are several options for your second paper. **Pick one**. Here are some general guidelines: 

1. Write 1250-1500 words. This does not include the bibliography. 
2. Use only the *Republic*, my notes, and the resources listed under 'Ancient Philosophy Resources'. 
3. If you paraphrase, quote, or in anyway use material you read elsewhere, then make sure to appropriately cite it and include a bibliography. Please visit the HUB for a citation tutorial if you want instruction in academic citation practices. When citing one of the Platonic texts, use the Stephanus numbers. (See the primer on the website.) 
4. **Great academic writing involves the appropriate use and citation of other work.** It's how you use and cite work that matters. The plagiarism software will detect if you use another's work. I will check how you used it. 
5. The goal is to teach you to explicitly engage with a text. You should be writing things like, 'Socrates says X, Y, and Z. He seems to mean this, that, and the other. Perhaps, though, we could take X to mean something else.' This type of assignment is far more focused on textual analysis than a non-historical philosophy course. When reading your draft ask yourself how much you write explicitly about what Socrates is saying and what your beliefs are on the topic. Much more space should be devoted to Socrates. 



## Option 1

As clearly and completely as you can, explain how Glaucon attempts to argue in *Republic* Bk. 2 that justice is something we desire **only** for its consequences. 


## Option 2

As clearly and completely as you can, explain Plato's account of the just soul in *Republic* Bk.4. Make sure to explain the tripartite division of the soul, and explain how he locates justice in the soul by distinguishing it from moderation, courage, and wisdom. 

## Option 3

As clearly and completely as you can, explain how Socrates argues in Bk 8-9 of the *Republic* that the city arranged in the way he has hypothetically created it is better than all other types of cities.
