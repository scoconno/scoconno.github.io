Email is the best way to reach me. I answer emails on weekdays, usually within 24 hrs.


### Note for Students

Email and Blackboard messages are the only ways to contact me. Do not telephone the Philosophy Department office. They will not give you my private number and I am unlikely able to take your call in my office. I will not reply to voice mails. 

Please check the syllabus before contacting me. If it is covered in the syllabus, I likely won’t respond. If you would like a response, please adhere to these basic email etiquette guidelines:

+ Use your NJCU email account to send email. To comply with Federal Law I will not respond to non-NJCU email addresses. 
	+ Find out how to set up your NJCU email on iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch [here.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-iPhone-iPad-or-iPod-Touch-b2de2161-cc1d-49ef-9ef9-81acd1c8e234#BKMK_WorkOrSchool)
	+ Find out how to set up your NJCU email on an Android phone or tablet [here.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-an-Android-phone-or-tablet-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872#BKMK_O365SetUp) 
+  Keep the body of your email brief and to the point. If it’s longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead.
+ Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure.
+ Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentences, avoid text-speak, and emoticons. 
+ Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor’s name]).
+ End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name.
+ Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example.

Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing!
