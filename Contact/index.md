### Note for Students

Do not telephone the Philosophy Department office. They will not give you my private number and I am unlikely able to take your call in my office. I will not reply to voice mails. Email and Blackboard messages are the only ways to contact me.
But please do check the syllabus before contacting me. If it is covered in the syllabus, I likely won’t respond. If you would like a response, please adhere to these basic email etiquette guidelines:

+ Use your NJCU email account to send email. To comply with Federal Law I will not respond to non-NJCU email addresses. 
+  Keep the body of your email brief and to the point. If it’s longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead.
+ Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure.
+ Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentences, avoid text-speak, and emoticons. 
+ Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor’s name]).
+ End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name.
+ Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example.

Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing!
