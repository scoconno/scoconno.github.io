## Grading Information

Assignments are graded using these two rubrics: 

+ [Rubric for short writing assignments,](ShortRubric.pdf) e.g., short essays, reading responses, discussion questions, etc. 
+ [Rubric for long writing assignments,](LongRubric.pdf) e.g., research papers, longer essays, independent projects, etc. 

For the abbreviations used in the margin (normally only for longer assignments), see [here.](/Teaching/Abbreviations)


## Timeline

I teach several courses and have various service and research commitments. So, unless otherwise indicated, it can take up to two weeks for me to grade and return your assignments.
