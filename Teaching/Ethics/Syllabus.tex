The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Course Description}

Aristotle's ethical theory has exerted a profound influence on the history of Western Philosophy.  In this course we will aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of his ethics, focusing on its presentation in the \emph{Nicomachean Ethics}.  Central notions we will examine include happiness or human  flourishing, virtue or excellence, responsibility, practical or moral wisdom, moral failure, friendship,  and pleasure.   


\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) read philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv)
write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of Aristotle's ethics, (vi) manage their studies in a responsible and timely manner.
