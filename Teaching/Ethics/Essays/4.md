## Book 3 Ch.6-12

Write a short story about three characters. One character is couragous, one is fool-hardy, one is a coward. In your story, the character must clearly demonstrate the **feelings** and **actions** that Aristotle thinks representative of these three types of individuals. I suggest identifying some event, some scenario, that would allow you compare the feelings and actions of these figures. 

In grading this paper, I will be examining whether you fully understand Aristotle's views of courage.
