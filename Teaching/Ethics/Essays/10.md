## Book IX

In Book IX, chapter 8, Aristotle asks whether we should love ourselves more than we love anyone else. The question is difficult as there are very good reasons for thinking that we both should and should not love ourselves more than others. 

In this paper, (1) explain the arguments for the claim that we should not love ourselves more than others, (2) explain the arguments for the claim that we should love ourselves more than anyone else, and (3) explain how Aristotle solves the paradox.
