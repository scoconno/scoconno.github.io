The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Catalog Description}

This course teaches students to identify and evaluate those beliefs that guide their thoughts and actions. Reflecting on different sources, students identify those philosophical beliefs that play a role in their own lives. By developing their critical thinking skills, they learn how to clarify, systematize, and assess these beliefs. 

\section{Course Description}

Aristotle's ethical theory has exerted a profound inuence on the history of Western Philosophy.  In this course we will aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of his ethics, focusing on its presentation in the Nicomachean Ethics.  Central notions we will examine include eudaimonia (happiness or human  flourishing), arete (virtue or excellence), phronesis (practical or moral wisdom), akrasia (lack  of  self-control), philia (friendship),  and  (pleasure).   We  will  also  consider  some  of the  scholarly  debate  over  the  interpretation  of  Aristotle's  ethics,  and  delve  into  some  of  the  recent literature that takes inspiration from Aristotle (especially so-called `virtue ethics') or takes up philosophical issues his ethics raises.


Happiness. 
What is it? The relationship between ethical life and happiness. What is pleasure and how does it fit in with both a happy life and ethical life? What is friendship? What distinguishes true friend from a fake friend? Answer to this too. Do you need friends to be happy. 

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) read
philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv)
write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and
persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of several core
philosophical topics, (vi) manage their studies in a responsible and timely manner.

Dates refer to the first day of the week. Readings marked with a `**' can be found on the course website. All other listed readings can be found in the required textbook. Changes to the syllabus will be announced through Blackboard and \emph{via} your NJCU email address.\\

Listed here are the readings we will be discussing during each session.  Although assigned sections are often short, they are difficult, and multiple readings are strongly advised.
