## Gobbets (Book 5)


Sentence 1:
: It is clear, then, that there are several sorts of justice and that there is a distinct sort beyond virtue as a whole (1130b6).

Sentence 2:
: What is just, then, is this: what is proportionate. What is unjust, on the other hand, is what is contrary to what is proportionate (1131b16).

Sentence 3:
: The puzzle about doing an unjust action to oneself is generally resolved, however, by reference to the de nition concerned with suf- fering an unjust action voluntarily (1138b26).


## Introduction 

There are three gobbets. The numbers after each sentence refer to the Bekker numbers. You can find the Bekker numbers by first attending to the number at the top corner of each page and then looking for the numbers that occur in brackets after specific words. 

Remember 'gobbets' are reading quetions. You must do three things: 
1. Explain the context of the sentence, i.e., explain what Aristotle is doing in the chapter and how the sentence fits into that project. 
2. Explain the content/meaning of the sentence. 
3. Assess the sentence, i.e., state what you think the sentence contributes to Aristotle's overall project, or raise an objection, or raise an interesting question, etc.
