## Gobbets (Book 6)


Sentence 1:
: Let us call one of these "the scientific part" and the other "the rationally calculative part" (1139a12).

Sentence 2:
: It is evident too that theoretical wisdom cannot be the same as politics (1141a30).

Sentence 3:
: It is clear, then, from what we have said, that it is neither possible to be fully good without practical wisdom nor practically-wise without virtue of character (1144b29).


## Introduction 

There are three gobbets. The numbers after each sentence refer to the Bekker numbers. You can find the Bekker numbers by first attending to the number at the top corner of each page and then looking for the numbers that occur in brackets after specific words. 

Remember 'gobbets' are reading quetions. You must do three things: 
1. Explain the context of the sentence, i.e., explain what Aristotle is doing in the chapter and how the sentence fits into that project. 
2. Explain the content/meaning of the sentence. 
3. Assess the sentence, i.e., state what you think the sentence contributes to Aristotle's overall project, or raise an objection, or raise an interesting question, etc.
