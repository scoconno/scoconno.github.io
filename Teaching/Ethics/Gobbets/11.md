## Gobbets (Book 7 ch.11-14 & Book 10 ch.1--5)


Sentence 1:
: But the bodily pleasures have stolen the name “pleasure,” because we most often direct our course toward them and because all share in them (1153b32).

Sentence 2:
: And pleasure completes |15| the activities and hence it completes living, which is something people  nd desirable.(1175a14).

Sentence 3:
: It is clear, then, that pleasures agreed to be shameful should be said not to be pleasures at all, except to people who have been ruined (1176b22).


## Introduction 

There are three gobbets. The numbers after each sentence refer to the Bekker numbers. You can find the Bekker numbers by first attending to the number at the top corner of each page and then looking for the numbers that occur in brackets after specific words. 

Remember 'gobbets' are reading quetions. You must do three things: 
1. Explain the context of the sentence, i.e., explain what Aristotle is doing in the chapter and how the sentence fits into that project. 
2. Explain the content/meaning of the sentence. 
3. Assess the sentence, i.e., state what you think the sentence contributes to Aristotle's overall project, or raise an objection, or raise an interesting question, etc.
