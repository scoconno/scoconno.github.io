## Gobbets (Book IX)


Sentence 1:
: A decent person, then, has each of these features in relation to himself and is related to his friend as he is to himself, since his friend is another himself (1166b29). 

Sentence 2:
: A base person, then, is apparently not so disposed as to be fitted for friendship even toward himself, because he has nothing lovable (1167a24).

Sentence 3:
: Hence a happy person does need friends (1169b21). 


## Introduction 

There are three gobbets. The numbers after each sentence refer to the Bekker numbers. You can find the Bekker numbers by first attending to the number at the top corner of each page and then looking for the numbers that occur in brackets after specific words. 

Remember 'gobbets' are reading quetions. You must do three things: 
1. Explain the context of the sentence, i.e., explain what Aristotle is doing in the chapter and how the sentence fits into that project. 
2. Explain the content/meaning of the sentence. 
3. Assess the sentence, i.e., state what you think the sentence contributes to Aristotle's overall project, or raise an objection, or raise an interesting question, etc.
