## Gobbets (Book IV)


Sentence 1:
: A wasteful person, for his part, errs in these matters too, since he is neither pleased nor pained at the things he should or in the way he should (1121a8).

Sentence 2:
: For a great-souled person is justified in despising others, since his beliefs are true, but ordinary people despise others in a random way (1124b4).

Sentence 3:
: As for a person who is repelled by everything, we have said that he is disagreeable and quarrelsome (1127a8).


## Introduction 

There are three gobbets. The numbers after each sentence refer to the Bekker numbers. You can find the Bekker numbers by first attending to the number at the top corner of each page and then looking for the numbers that occur in brackets after specific words. 

Remember 'gobbets' are reading questions. You must do three things: 
1. Explain the context of the sentence, i.e., explain what Aristotle is doing in the chapter and how the sentence fits into that project. 
2. Explain the content/meaning of the sentence. 
3. Assess the sentence, i.e., state what you think the sentence contributes to Aristotle's overall project, or raise an objection, or raise an interesting question, etc.
