## Independent Project-Stage 3


### Introduction

Great progress! You have a question. You have identified a dozen or so readings that are relevant to that question. You have explained the background to your questions and sketched out some standard answers in the literature. Congratulate yourself on how much research you have now done.

Now that you have surveyed the literature, it is time for you to form your own opinions on the question. Do you think one of the answers that has been defended is correct? If so, why that one as opposed to another? Do you think there is an ignored alternative? Now is the time for you to advance the conversation. 

I hope that you are beginning to realize that research is a very gradual process. Forming your own views is also a gradual process. Researchers don't come up with something new overnight. They take the germ of an idea, mull over it, talk about it with peers and colleagues, and slowly develop it. 

This presentation provides you the opportunity to formulate your views before writing your final paper. Researchers often do present their findings at conferences before publishing them. So too you will be presenting to your colleagues your views on your topic. 

Since you might not have given a presentation before, I am going to give you very structured instructions.  

### Requirements 


Write 6 slides. Each slide should contain a striking picture, or quote, or graph, or other visual cue. It must also provide in bullet form a summary of the main point of the slide. You will be using your slides as cues---do not put the entire text on the slide. The 6 slides must be written as follows (each number corresponds to a slide): 

1. Relevant background on your topic.
2. Question raised. 
3. Answer 1.
4. Answer 2.
5. Your novel contribution introduced. 
6. Evidence/support/argument for your novel contribution.


### Grading

This assignment is worth 10 points. The breakdown is as follows: 
+ 1 point per slide (6 points total)
+ 4 points peer review (average response)
