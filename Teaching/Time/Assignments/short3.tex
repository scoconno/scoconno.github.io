\subsubsection{Prompt}\label{prompt}

Sigh. Another day. Another crime. Another victim. Another trial. Another
person set for prison. I've done this court psychologist thing for too
long now. I know why they did it. It's not their fault they are they way
they are. Nobody ever asked them what kind of person they wanted to be.
Here they are a victim to their upbringing, it causing them to do this
terrible thing. And what do we do? We blame them for something they had
no control over and leave them wasting in a prison. Enough. I'm making a
stand. I'll convince this judge that the defendant had no control
whatsoever. I don't care if I lose my job.

You are a psychologist for the NJ court system. Your job is to
psychologically assess defendants. You must determine whether they
committed the crime of their own free will. You primarily ask why the
person has the character traits they have and ask whether their behavior
is determined by those character traits. You interview their friends,
family, and colleagues. You find out whatever you can about their
upbringing and how it shaped the person they are today. You then write a
short report to the judge outlining your findings. The odd twist is that
today you are determined to prove that the defendant's character is
responsible for their action and that they had \textbf{no control} over
having that character.

Identify some \textbf{real} crime and prepare the psychological report
of the defendant for the court. You can find a case by looking at old
newspapers. NJ.com and nytimes.com are good places to start. Find out as
many details as you can about the defendant. Make some up if you need
to. Then prepare a report in which you (1) identify the main features of
the person's character, (2) argue that the character arose from their
upbringing (make sure to give details, anecdotes, etc), and (3) explain
how their particular character explains the crime they committed.
