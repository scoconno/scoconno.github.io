## Independent Project-Stage 1


### Introduction
Every discipline asks some question about time. Thatâ€™s what makes it such a good topic. Hopefully, you have already started asking some of these questions yourselves. The purpose of this independent project is to teach you how to research a topic that interests you. That involves teaching you how to find relevant information.  

But where do you start? We are going to break up the process into several stages. In this first stage, you will be doing two distinct things. You will first clearly articulate some question about time. By 'clearly articulate', I mean that the question must be a simple 'what', 'why', or 'how' question. It should be one sentence long, i.e., require no big interlude. And it must be a question that is small enough that you can feasibly have a chance of answering it within the next 3 months. 

After articulating your question, you will **begin** to prepare an annotated bibliography that addresses that topic. 

### What is an annotated bibliography? 

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and documents. Each citation is followed by a brief (usually about 150 words) descriptive and evaluative paragraph, the annotation. 

The purpose of the annotation is to inform the reader of the relevance, accuracy, and quality of the sources cited. The idea here is that you are creating and collecting a small number of documents that you can then use to write your large research paper.

### The Process 

Creating an annotated bibliography calls for the application of a variety of intellectual skills: concise exposition, succinct analysis, and informed library research.

1.  Locate and record citations to books, periodicals, and
    documents that may contain useful information and ideas on
    your topic. While you can use the library website, you should also go into the library. If you locate a book you think is useful, look at
    the rest of the shelf. Often you will find other
    relevant material.
    - **NB:** Use librarians! One of the main jobs of an academic librarian is to help users find research material. Tell them what you are interested in and they will help you figure out what to read.
    - Digital resources are terrible risky. There is as much false information online as there is accurate information. If you do use online resources, try only to use resources found through the library's website. 

2.  Briefly examine and review the actual items. While you only
    need to skim these sources, you need to read them closely enough to
    decide whether they are relevant.</span>

3.  <span>Choose those works that provide a variety of perspectives on
    your topic. Discard those that are irrelevant.</span>

4.  <span>Cite the book, article, or document using the your preferred
    citation style, e.g., APA, Chicago, etc.</span>

5.  <span>Write a concise annotation that summarizes the central theme
    and scope of the book or article. Include one or more sentences
    that (a) evaluates the authority or background of the author, (b)
    comment on the intended audience, (c) compare or contrast this work
    with another you have cited, or (d) explain how this work
    illuminates your bibliography topic.</span>

### Requirements 

+ Your question must be 1) about time, 2) clearly stated, 3) concrete, and 4) concern a topic that can be researched within the next 3 months.

+ Your annotated bibliography must include **citations**  for
2-3 background sources, whether they are encyclopedias, news stories, or blog entries; and 8-10 scholarly sources, whether they be articles from scholarly journals or books published by academic publishers.

+ Your annotated bibliography must include **annotations** for 1 background source and 2 scholarly sources.

+ **NB: You are being asked to collect and cite several sources that discuss your topic, but I am asking you to summarize just a few of these sources. I encourage you to complete the annotations for the rest of the citations before you turn later in the semester to writing your papers, but that is not a requirement for this assignment.** 

### Grading

I will grade your submissions based on how well formulated the questions ares, how relevant the sources are, and how well you describe those sources (1 background, 2 academic).
