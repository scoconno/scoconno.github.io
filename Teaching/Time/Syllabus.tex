\section{Course Description}

We are temporal creatures. We structure our lives around a sense of our history, of what we were in the past, and what we hope to be in the future. Our societies are also essentially temporal. Political, economic, and cultural institutions value certain units of time over others. Work weeks must not exceed a certain length. Elections must happen on certain fixed dates. The measuring of time is both essential to us and the societies we live in. But what exactly is it that we are measuring?

  In this course, we will examine the nature of time and the role it plays in our lives and societies more generally. We begin by discussing the history of time-measurement and various struggles peoples have encountered in measuring it. From there we move to discuss how these struggles have shaped, often profoundly, the development of different societies and cultures. Next we will  discuss  time and the person specifically focusing on two questions. The first is how we could survive as the same person as we change over time. The second is how we perceive and understand time. If we want to understand the importance of time to us and our societies, we need to know what it is. To discuss this, we'll look at two distinct questions. The first is the nature of temporal passage and arguments that suggest that both it and time may, in fact, not exist at all.  The second is about the direction of time. Why is it that time unfolds in the particular direction that it does? Could it flow backwards? We'll conclude by thinking about the future prospects of time. In particular, we will look at the possibility of time-travel and how its advent might radically re-shape our conceptions of ourselves and the societies we live in. 



\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) find the argument of a text and clearly restate it, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that are not their own, (iii) think critically, (iv) write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate a substantive grasp of how time is an  important topic of study in several distinct disciplines.
