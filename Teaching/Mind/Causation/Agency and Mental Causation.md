+ Mental to mental causation, e.g., beliefs lead to another belief

+ Physical to mental causation, e.g., perception causes a perceptual experience

+ Mental to physical causation, e.g., beliefs and desires cause actions

+ Physical to physical causation, e.g., heating causes water to boil

Q: Through what mechanism or process does a mental event manage to initiate, or insert itself into, a causal chain of physical events?

## Epiphenomenalism

**Epiphenomenalism:** mental events are caused by physical events, but they cannot cause anything else.


## Evidence for epiphenomenalism

1. Brain damage
2. Animal behavior

## Problem 1

1. If mental events have no causal powers, then they are in total causal isolation from the rest of the world -- their existence would be inexplicable since they have no causes; they would make no difference to anything else since they have no effects.2. If anything is both causeless and effectless, then it cannot really exist.[Alexander's Dictum]3. According to epiphenomenalism, mental events have no causal powers whatsoever.4. Therefore, under epiphenomenalism, mental events are not real. ⇒ [Mental Irrealism]


## Problem 2: Agency

**Agency:** If agent S desires something and believes that doing A is an optimal way of securing it, S will do A.
 
**Rationality:** Reasons are the causes of our actions.

1. We perform actions for reasons. 
2. The reasons for which we perform an action are the cause of that action.
3. Actions involve bodily movements. 
3. Therefore, reasons are the cause of bodily movement. 
4. Therefore, mental events cause bodily events. 
5. If epiphenomenalism is true, mental events cannot cause bodily events.
6. If epiphenomenalism is true, we do not perform actions for reasons. 



## Causal Exclusion Problem

+ P1. M is a cause of p


**Causal Closure of the Physical Domain:** If a physical event has a cause (occurring) at time t, it has a sufficient physical cause at t.


+ Example 1: If the glass breaking has a physical cause at 10am, the glass breaking has a sufficient physical cause at 10am

+ Example 2: If the water boiling has a physical cause at 2pm, the water boiling has....? 

+ Example 3: If my leg moving has a physical cause at 9am, my leg moving has a sufficient physical cause at 9am


+ P1. m is a cause of p
+ P2. p is a cause of P...from causal closure
+ P3. m ≠ p
 

**Exclusion Principle:** No event has two or more distinct sufficient causes, all occurring at the same time, unless it is a genuine case of overdetermination.

+ P1. m is a cause of p
+ P2. p is a cause of P...from causal closure
+ P3. m ≠ p
+ P4. Mental causation is not an instance of overdetermination.

**But P1--P3 entail** that this is case of overdetermination!!! Since there is a contradiction between P1-P4, at least one of these claims is false. Which should we reject? 

Many claim we should reject P1. Our argument against mental causation looks then like this: 

+ P1. m is a cause of p
+ P2. p is a cause of P...from causal closure
+ P3. m ≠ p
+ P4. Mental causation is not an instance of overdetermination.
+ C1. Hence, m is not a cause of p, and (1) is false
+ C2. Hence, Mental events never cause physical events.



 


> Suppose that a mental event, m, causes a physical event, p. The closure principle says that there must also be a physical cause of p—an event, p , occurring at the same time as m, that is a sufficient cause of p. This puts us in a dilemma: Either we have to say that m = p-namely, identify the mental cause with the physical cause as a single event—or else we have to say that p has two distinct causes, m and p , that is, it is causally overdetermined. The first horn turns what was supposed to be a case of mental-to-physical causation into an instance of physical-to-physical causation, a result only a reductionist physicalist would welcome. Grasping the second horn of the dilemma would force us to admit that every case of mental-to-physical causation is a case of causal overdetermination, one in which a physical cause, even if the mental cause had not occurred, would have brought about the physical effect. This seems like a bizarre thing to believe, but quite apart from that, it appears to weaken the status of the mental event as a cause of the physical effect. To vindicate m as a full and genuine cause of p, we should be able to show that m can bring about p on its own, without there being a synchronous physical event that also serves as a sufficient cause of p. According to our reasoning, however, every mental event has a physical partner that would have brought about the effect anyway, even if the mental cause were taken out of play entirely (Kim pp)


## Problem 1

* The problem of mental causation under the assumption that there are no immaterial substances like souls:
___ 1. How is it possible for a mental event to cause, or to be caused by, a physical
event?
___ 2. How is it possible for an instantiation of a mental property to cause a physical
property to be instantiated, or vice versa?
Q: Why is this a problem?
A: The incompatibility between the lawful nature of physical causation and the
unlawfulness of mental causation.
___ Causality is lawful and not random. If an event of type A causes an event of type B, then in general all events of type A must cause events of type B. It cannot just be a happy coincidence. But when a mental event (such as having a desire) causes a physical event (such as an action), there is no lawlike regularity. So, could it be that it is not a causal relationship after all?
