## What is Consciousness? 

> The most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena is very poorly understood (436).

## Varieties of Consciousness

Sentience: 
: being able to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli.

Wakefulness: 
: being awake and capable of attending to something.

Autonomy: 
: deliberate control of one's behavior.

Introspection: 
: the internal accessibility of one's mental states

Communicability: 
: the reportability of one's mental states

Phenomenal consciousness:
: the first-person experience—what it is like to be something


 > fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to *be* that organism-something it is like *for* the organism (436).

Nagel uses the metaphor of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts




 Bats are mammals, so they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptional experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and eat bugs like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.[6]

Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, “our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience”, meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (Subjectivism). Objectivity, requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.

Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind-body problem.
