## Turing Test


Is Data sentient?

Riker’s Argument
================

-   Data is a machine, an android.

    -   An android is an automaton made to resemble a human being.

-   His purpose is to serve human needs.

-   He was built by a human.

-   His responses are dictated by sophisticated software/programming.

Picard’s Rebuttal
=================

-   Humans are machines too, yet they are sentient.

-   Some humans have been used to do the work and menial tasks of
    others, yet they are sentient.

-   Humans are created by humans, yet they are sentient.

    -   Humans come from the building descriptions of their parents’
        DNA.

    -   Humans can be created in laboratories (my addition).

Picard’s Positive Argument
==========================

-   Maddox has as much reason for considering Data sentient as he does
    for considering Picard sentient.

-   Data has wants. He values some things that remind him of friendship
    and service. Tasha was special to him; they were intimate. This is
    evidence of having a mind.

-   Data satisfies Maddox’s conditions for sentience:

    Intelligence:
    :   ability to learn, understand, cope with new situations.

    Self-aware:
    :   aware of yourself and own ego. Aware of existence and actions.

    Conscious:
    :   ?

Alan Turing
===========

Biography
=========

-   Cambridge mathematician. Father of Artificial Intelligence.

-   Worked on Government Code and Cypher School in Bletchley Park and
    was key to breaking German naval Enigma.

-   Prosecuted for homosexuality in 1952, chemically castrated, died in
    1954 by suicide, and given a posthumous pardon in 2013.

Can Machines Think?
===================

-   Can machines do what we as thinking beings can do?

-   Can machine cause an interrogator to wrongly identify it to the same
    degree that an ordinary man or woman could?

-   Are there *imaginable digital* computers that would do well in the
    game?

> If the interrogator decides wrongly as often when the game is played
> with the computer as he does when the game is played between a man and
> a woman, it may be argued that the computer is intelligent.

Control Case
============

-   Decision, convincing, and deception via teletype connection.

-   Interrogator asks questions in written natural language.

-   Receives answers in written natural language.

-   Questions can be on any subject imaginable, from mathematics to
    poetry, from the weather to chess.

Digital Computer
================

-   A Digital Computer is a machine intended to carry out any operation
    which could be done by a human computer. It has three parts:

    Store
    :   is a store of information. It’s like the paper or book that a
        human computer uses when doing their calculations.

    Executive unit
    :   carries out the various operations.

    Control
    :   is like the rules or instructions for carrying out the
        calculation. It’s job is to ensure that instructions are obeyed
        correctly and in the right order.

<span>We can dramatically increase the size and power of these three
parts. So even if we don’t yet have a powerful enough computer that
passes the Turing Test, we might build one by increasing the power and
size of these parts.</span>

Clarifying the Turing Test
==========================

<span>Our Question</span>

-   Is passing the Turing Test necessary for intelligence?

-   Is passing the Turing Test sufficient for intelligence?

Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
===================================

<span>P is necessary for Q =</span>

-   Q cannot be true unless P is true.

-   Q entails P.

<span>P is sufficient for Q =</span>

-   P entails Q.

Examples
========

<span>The Olympics</span>

-   Having access to a snowboard is necessary for competing in the
    snowboard contests at the Olympics, but it is is not sufficient for
    doing so.

-   Winning a medal in a snowboard contest at the Olympics is sufficient
    for becoming an Olympic medal winner, but it is not necessary for
    becoming one.

<span>Give an example of conditions that satisfy the following
descriptions: </span>

-   Necessary, but not sufficient.

-   Sufficient, but not necessary.

-   Necessary and sufficient.

<span>Our Question</span>

-   Is passing the Turing Test necessary for intelligence?

-   Is passing the Turing Test sufficient for intelligence?

<span>Here’s why it’s a tricky question:</span>

-   Turing thinks that the question whether machines can think is
    meaningless.

-   He believes that ‘being able to think’ just means ‘being able to
    pass the test’.

-   Being able to pass the Test is then constitutive of being
    intelligent.

Turing’s Defense of the Imitation Game
======================================

Strategy
========

Turing defends his claim that passing the test is constitutive of being
intelligent by responding to several objections.

1.  Argument from Extrasensory Perception

2.  Argument from Various Disabilities

3.  The Argument from Consciousness

4.  The Mathematical Objection

5.  Argument from the Informality of Behavior

6.  Lady Lovelace’s Objection

ESP Objection
=============

<span>Objection</span> If the human participant in the game was
telepathic, then the interrogator, who is also human, could exploit this
fact in order to determine the identity of the machine.

<span>Response</span> Turing proposes that the competitors should be
housed in a “telepathy-proof room.”

Argument from Various Disabilities
==================================

<span>Objection</span>

> Machines cannot do many things that humans can, e.g.,be kind, be
> resourceful, be beautiful, be friendly, have initiative, have a sense
> of humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy
> strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from
> experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought,
> have as much diversity of behavior as a man, do something really new.

<span>Response</span>

-   The objection relies on an inductive inference. You know that
    particular machines have various disabilities and then infer that
    all present and future machines will have various disabilities.

-   Induction can fail!

Induction
=========

<span>Explication</span> Induction is a sort of non-deductive inference.
We infer that since some instances of a certain group have a certain
attribute that the next members of that group will have that attribute.

<span>Examples</span>

-   The sun rose every day that I remember, hence, the sun will rise
    tomorrow.

-   Every lion I have seen was a golden yellow color, hence every lion I
    will see will be a golden yellow color.

<span>The Problem with Induction</span> Inductive inferences are not
deductive valid. They are also difficult to justify.

The Argument from Consciousness
===============================

<span>Objection</span>

> “Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because
> of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols,
> could we agree that machine equals brain—that is, not only write it
> but know that it had written in it.”

1.  A being can think only if it can know that it thinks.

2.  Computers cannot know that they think.

3.  Computers cannot think. (From 1 and 2)

<span>Response: Reject 2</span>

1.  The evidence we could have that a being is self-aware is either from
    their reports or from being that being.

2.  We cannot be another being.

3.  So the only evidence we have that another being is self-aware is
    their reports that they are self-aware. (From 1&2)

4.  Computers can report that they are self-aware. (From performance in
    Turing Test)

5.  So we have evidence that they are self-aware. (From 3&4)

In addition, if the machine gave sufficiently complex answers about how
it wrote poetry, we would likely think that it is, in fact, conscious.

The Mathematical Objection
==========================

<span>Objection</span>

1.  Within any consistent formal system there are statements that can
    neither be proved nor disproved within that system.

2.  Suppose that a computing machine is a formal system that operates by
    proving or disproving various statements put to it, i.e., by
    answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to various questions put to it.

3.  There will be questions a computing machine gives wrong answers to
    (From 1 and 2; the machine, in some cases, should say that there is
    no correct answer.)

4.  Intelligent beings are not so limited.

5.  A computing machine is not intelligent. (From 3 and 4)

<span>Response: Reject 4</span>

1.  There are questions that humans can’t answer, yet they are
    intelligent.

2.  It could be that the inability to answer every question is due to
    precisely the same limitations that restrict the capacity of
    machines.

Objection from the Informality of Behavior
==========================================

<span>Objection</span>

> ‘’If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he
> regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are
> no such rules, so men cannot be machines.’’

<span>Response. Distinguish</span>

Laws of Conduct:
:   Precepts such as “Stop if you see red lights,” on which one can act,
    and of which one can be conscious.

Laws of Behavior:
:   Laws of nature as applied to a man’s body such as “if you pinch him
    he will squeak.” (We do not act upon these laws, nor is it important
    that we are conscious of them.)

-   Agrees that if there is a definite set of laws of behavior that
    regulate X’s life, then x is a machine.

-   Denies that being regulated by laws of conduct are relevant for
    determining if X is a machine.

-   Agrees that there is no definite set of laws of conduct that
    regulate human life.

-   Denies that there is no definite set of laws of behavior that
    regulate human life.

-   It follows that humans are machines as much as computers.

Lady Lovelace’s Objection
=========================

<span>Objection</span> Machines have “no pretensions to *originate
anything*. It can do *whatever we know how to order it to perform*.”

<span>Response</span>

-   The objection assumes that machines cannot learn.

-   But it is possible for machines to learn.
