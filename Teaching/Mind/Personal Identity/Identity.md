Personal Identity
Compare a picture of you taken yesterday to a picture taken of you just after birth. Are the people depicted in the photographs the same person? They certainly seem different. 

- human undergo complete cellular replacement every severn years.  
- you could put the life after death thing here. Questions about reincarnation. A person claims to have memories of incidents long time ago. Are they the same person as that from years ago? 

## Understanding the Question

English can mislead us when trying to answer these questions. The words `identity', `identical', `similar', and 'same' are ambiguous; they can be used to describe different relations. And whenever a word can be used in several ways, we need to disambiguate those uses to answer questions that contain them. If a person told you they left their car near the bank, they could mean they left it near the money bank or the river bank. It's obviously important to identify which one they mean. 

`Same' (and our other words) can also be used in different ways. On the one hand, it can be used to speak about qualitative similarity. Qualitative similarity is something that numerically distinct objects enjoy by sharing similar features. Two chairs are qualitatively similar in virtue of having similar shapes, sizes, and function. But they are still two chairs; if you buy both, you will have to pay twice the cost of one. 

We can also use these words to talk about what is called numerical identity, the relation that each thing holds to itself and nothing else. Clark Kent and Superman are numerically identical. `Numerical identity' is used when we want to say that there is just one entity to be counted. Suppose you know that Superman and Clark Kent were in the room. You would make a mistake if you counted them as two people; there is just one person there. 

Humans obviously change their qualities over time. You and the baby you grew from share few, if any, features. You may have the same color eyes, but you are different sizes, different weight, made of different cells, different hair lengths, different tastes and dispositions. Nevertheless, you and that baby are numerically identical. 

It is important that you and that baby are numerically identical. Numerical identity undergirds many of our moral and social institutions. The social security number assigned to that baby belongs to whoever is numerically identical to her. Being only qualitatively similar does not suffice. That would mean a twin could get that baby's social security. The prison sentence delivered to a defendant should only be served by prisoners identical to that defendant. Suppose a prisoner is in the 10th year of a prison sentence for a crime committed by a person that they are only qualitatively similar to. What an injustice that would be! They would be serving a sentence for a crime that they did not commit. 

- alss important for answering questions of survival after death. 

Nevertheless that prisoner might be very different from the defendant. They may have had a religious conversion, changed their body shape, etc. Allow 'P' stand for a person existing now. And 'Q' stand for the person depicted the baby. You can use your own variable is you like. P is numerically identical to Q. 



What is Numerical Identity?
===========================

-   It is a relation that is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive.

-   It is a relation that everything bears to itself and nothing else.

    -   A relation R is reflexive iff everything bears R to itself.

        Example: everything is *the same height* as itself. ‘The same
        height’ is a reflexive relation.

    -   A relation R is symmetric iff, if x is related by R to y, then y
        is related by R to x.

        -   Example: if Susan is *a sibling of* Sarah, then Sarah is *a
            sibling of* Susan. ‘Being a sibling of’ is a symmetrical
            relation.

    -   A relation R is transitive iff, if x is related by R to y, and y
        is related by R to z, then x is related by R to z.

        -   Example: if Susan is *shorter than* Sarah, and Sarah is
            *shorter than* Hannah, then Susan is *shorter than* Hannah.
            ‘Short than’ is a transitive relation.


Arguing About Identity
======================

Allow ‘=’ for ‘numerically identical to’

-   Riker = Thomas.

-   Riker = William.

-   Thomas = William.

-   Identity is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive!\
     \

-   Thomas = William.

-   Councilor Troy kissed Thomas on the holodeck.

-   Councilor Troy kissed William on the holodeck.

-   If Riker $\neq$ either Thomas or William, then Riker’s father lost
    his son and should mourn him.

-   Riker $\neq$ either Thomas or William.

-   Riker’s father lost his son and should mourn him.

-   If Riker committed a crime, he should be punished.

-   Riker = either Thomas or William, but not both.

-   If Riker = Thomas, then Thomas but not William should be punished
    for Riker’s crimes.

-   If Riker = William, then William but not Thomas should be punished
    for Riker’s crimes.








Survival
========

Two Considerations
------------------

-   G survives iff there is a person P at a time after her body has died
    such that G is identical to P.

-   Survival must offer comfort of anticipation, e.g., it must make
    sense for G to look forward to P’s pleasures and to fear P’s pains.

Conceiving Survival

-   Persons must be such that we can *coherently* conceive a possible
    situation in which some person P exists yet 1) P does not have G’s
    body, and 2) G = P

-   What are we conceiving persons to be in such a situation?

Remember! Qualitative similarity *vs.* numerical identity.

-   Two ginger bread men made by the same cookie cutter are
    qualitatively similar in several respects, e.g., they have the same
    shape, the same weight, the same colour, smell, and so on. But these
    are *two* numerically distinct entities.

-   Superman and Clark Kent are numerically identical, i.e., they are
    one and the same entity. If you want to count the number of entities
    in the room, you should only count Superman and Clark Kent once:
    Louis Lane makes a mistake when she counts them as two.


## What does personal identity consist in?

Despite their qualitative differences, what is it about P that makes her the very same person as Q? Three main answers have been defeneded: personal identity consists in sameness of body, sameness of soul, and psychological continuity. While each view has some virtues, each is problematic and there is currently no consensus on how to explain what makes you today identical to the person you grew up from. 

Our first view, the sameness of body view, says the following: 

+ A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if the body of A is identical to the body of B.

An obvious virtue of this view is that it explain how we are able to keep track and re-identify humans over time. We can perceive bodies. So, by perceiving bodies we should be able to keep track of them over time. 

But the problems are dramatic. On the one hand, it requires that the body of A is identical to the body of B. This then pushes the question back a step further. Despite the qualitative differences between these bodies what is it that ensures their numerical identity? No cell survives. Appearances change. DNA can be shared. 

Perhaps a deeper problem lies in the fact that our concept of personal identity allows for the admittedly bizarre examples of swaps as described in movies like 'Freak Friday' in which a young daughter and her mother change bodies. We'll never live to see such a strange case. It may be practically impossible for scientists to transfer one person to the another. But what is important about the example is that we have no conceptual difficulty in allowing that the person has swapped bodies. Our concept of personal identity is not strained by the movie. It was easy to imagine the people in different bodies. This shows something problematic. 


### Sameness of Soul
Our second theory may seem familiar. It states the following: 

+ A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time iff the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.

Belief in the existence of souls is commonplace in different religions both today and in history. There are, of course, different views about what souls are. Here I will outline a view of what souls that would allow them play a role in explaining personal identity. 

Body and soul are radically different.  Bodies are extended in 3-dimensions. Souls have no extension. There are simple bodies—-the basic bits of matter—-and complex bodies composed of matter. But souls are neither simple or complex bodies.

Souls are viewed as the seat of consciousness. For any thought and experience, there must be some entity which does the thinking and experiencing. Souls and not bodies are what think and experience.



Problems

-   A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time   iff the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.

-   What evidence is there for this claim?

-   How could we know that the soul of A is identical to the soul of B?

    1.  Direct experience?

    2.  Indirect experience: Same Body

    3.  Indirect experience: Same Psychology

Indirect Experience 1 Claim

-   Same body entails same soul.

-   We directly perceive bodies.

-   We indirectly perceive souls.

Problems

-   If we can know that B is true, then B can be known either *a posteriori* or *a priori*

-   B cannot be known *a posteriori*.

-   B cannot be known *a priori*.

-   Therefore, we cannot know that B is true.

With the chocolate, I can test. My test involves me perceiving both the chocolate and the inside. We keep checking and we come to know that certain wrapper is associated with certain filling. But we can’t check
whether souls are associated with bodies.

Indirect Experience 2 Claim

-   Same psychology entail same soul.

-   We can directly know that the psychology of A is the same as the psychology of B.

-   Thus we can indirectly know that the soul of A is the same as the soul of B.

Problems

-   If same psychology entailed same soul, then exemplification of
    psychological traits would be infallible evidence for sameness of
    soul.

-   Exemplification of psychological traits are not infallible evidence
    for sameness of soul.

-   Same psychology does not entail same soul.

Fallible vs. Infallible Evidence for Personal Identity

![image](twins.jpg)

Consider a scenario in which 1) a series of souls flow
into and out of the same body, and 2) that same body exhibits the same psychological traits. If personal identity consists in sameness of soul, then there is a numerically distinct person every time a soul is
exchanged. However, with every soul exchange there is no corresponding change in psychological traits. Thus, same psychology does not entail same soul.

### Psychological Continuity

It does seem important for psychological continuity.
