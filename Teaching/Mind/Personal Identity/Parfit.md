## Parfit


Introduction
============

Parfit Targets Two Beliefs

1.  There is always a definite answer to questions about personal
    identity.

2.  Unless questions about personal identity have a definite answer, we
    cannot answer certain other important questions about things such as
    survival, memory, and responsibility.

Belief 1
========

1.  If Thomas had not been created, we would have no reason to deny that
    Riker = William.

2.  If William had not been created, we would have no reason to deny
    that Riker = Thomas.

3.  Thomas $\neq$ William

4.  Riker $\neq$ *both* Thomas & William.

5.  Since Riker would be identical to one of Thomas or William if only
    one of them had been created, it is arbitrary to (i) say he is
    identical to neither of them, and to (ii) say he is identical to
    only one of them.

Indefiniteness

Belief 2
========

Parfit’s Strategy: Parfit argues that important questions about
survival, memory, and responsibility only appear to presuppose questions
about personal identity, and once they are freed from this
presupposition, we will see that personal identity is not that important
after all.

Master Argument

-   Identity is one-one and does not admit of degree.

-   What matters for survival is psychological continuity.

-   Psychological continuity need not be one-one and may admit of
    degree.

-   Therefore, identity is not what matters for survival.

Psychological Continuity Matters

What matters for survival is psychological continuity—that an
individual’s total mental state should be part of a succession on states
related by:

-   Similarity: change should be gradual

-   Lawful causal dependence (possibly featuring memory most
    prominently)

Surviving as Two

-   It is possible two persons A and B existing at t2 to be
    psychologically continuous with a person C existing at t1.

-   For all C should care, from a purely rational point of view, it is
    good enough for C to be psychologically continuous with *one or
    more* future persons, i.e., for all C should care, being continuous
    with A and B is good enough for C’s survival.
