## What we are doing each week
Find below links to notes, assignments, readings not in the textbook, and optional videos & readings. Consult the syllabus for a full list. 

**NB:** Each 'week' outlines what you will be working on for a given week (see syllabus for the full details).  The date after 'week' is our first meeting of the week. Readings for a particular week must be completed by that first meeting. There is also an assignment that you will work on during the week. The date indicates when it is due. Quizzes are both forward and backward looking. For instance, the quiz mentioned under 'week 5' will examine some of the material discussed during week 5 as well as some of the reading for week 6. Please ask if you have any questions.
