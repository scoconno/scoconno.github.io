## Functionalism

- Hilary Putnam killed it in the 1960s. Multiple realizability is the key issues. 
- Physical systems exhibit mentality. 
- Each occurrence of a physical property is due to the occurrence of a physical realizer of that mental property. 
- Minds, if they existed, must be embodied. 
- So C-fiber activation might realize pain in humans, but something else might realize this in other beings. 
- Engine could be built from many things. Run on gas, or electricity, or whatever. 
- Pain's job is related to its survival---tissue damage detectors. Causes withdrawal, avoidance, and escape. 
- Each mental state is a functional kind, or a causal-functional kind. Function is a certan causal role. 
- Causal conditions can include other mental states, e.g., you are alert. The outputs can include other mental states such as  a sense of distress or a desire to get rid of pain. 
- David Armstrong: the concept of a mental state is the concept of an internal state apt to be caused by certain sensory inputs and apt to cause certain behavioral outputs. A specification of input and output, <i, o>, will define a particular mental state: for example, <tissue damage, aversive behavior> defines pain, <skin irritation, scratching> defines itch, and so on.”

## Functional Properties and Their Realizers: Definitions 
“F is a functional property (or kind) just in case F can be characterized by a definition of the following form:
For something x to have F (or to be an F) = def for x to have some property P such that C(P), where C(P) is a specification of the causal work that P is supposed to do in x.”

Two functional properties are the same just if the causal role associated with them are the same. 

“Let F be a functional property defined by a functional definition, as above. Property Q is said to realize F, or be a realizer or a realization of F, in system x if and only if C(Q), that is, Q fits the specification C in x (which is to say, Q in fact performs the specified causal work in system x)”

“x is a mousetrap = defx has some property P such that P enables x to trap and hold or kill mice.”

So this applies to hearts--x is a heart = def x has some property P such that P enables x to pump blood

So this applies to pain--x is a pain state = def x has some property P such that P enable x to detect tissue damage. 

	- P could be different in different things. 

I was confused about what x is here. We are not claiming that Sam is in pain if Sam has some property that allows him detect tissue damage (though I guess that is also true). We are saying that some property P is 'being pain' if that property has the second order property of being able to detect tissue damage and cause stuff. 

## Functionalism and Behaviorism

1. F takes mental states to be real internal states with real causal roles. 

“Instrumentalist analysis: x is soluble in water = def if x is immersed in water, x dissolves.

Realist analysis: x is soluble in water = defx has an internal state S (for example, a certain microstructure) such that when x is immersed in water, S causes x to dissolve.”


## Turing Machines

Machine Functionalism---computational view of the mind


## Turing Test

“The idea is that if machines can do as well as humans on certain cognitive, intellectual tasks, then they must be judged no less psychological (“intelligent”) than humans. What, then, are these tasks? Obviously, they must be those that, intuitively, require intelligence and mentality to perform. Turing describes a game, the “imitation game,” to test for the presence of these capacities.”

“There are three players: the interrogator, a man, and a woman, with the interrogator segregated from the other two in another room. The man and woman are known only as “X” and “Y” to the interrogator, whose object is to identify which is the man and which is the woman by asking questions via keyboard terminals and monitors. The man’s object is to mislead the interrogator to make an erroneous identification, whereas the woman’s job is to help the interrogator. There are no restrictions on the topics of the questions asked.”

“Suppose, Turing says, we now replace the man with a computing machine. The machine is programmed to simulate the part played by the man to fool the interrogator into making wrong guesses. Will the machine do as well as the man in fooling the interrogator? Turing’s proposal is that if the machin”

“ By asking questions (or just holding a conversation) via keyboard terminals, can we find out whether we are conversing with a human or a computing machine? (This is the way the Turing test is now being conducted.) If a computer can consistently fool us so that our success in ascertaining its identity is no better than what could be achieved by random guesses, we must concede, it seems, that this machine has the kind of mentality that we grant to humans.”

Excerpt From: Kim, Jaegwon. “Philosophy of Mind.” iBooks. 

“Turing’s Thesis. If two systems are input-output equivalent, they have the same psychological status; in particular, one is mental, or intelligent, just in case the other is.”

Note that machine functionalism says that passing Turing Test is really necessary, but not sufficent for mentality
