## Behaviorism

Statement of the view. 

Importance of behavior to mind. 

Examples of animal psychology.

There are two types of behavior: physiological response and bodily movements. 

Example of pain. Pain is not the cause of groans and winces. Pain is, in fact, identical to the pain and grimaces. There is not, on this view, anything else beside the physiological responses and bodily movements. 

“Paul has a toothache” in behavioral terms. His translation consists of the following five clauses:11
a. Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds.
b. At the question “What is the matter?” Paul utters the words, “I have a toothache.”
c. Closer examination reveals a decayed tooth with exposed pulp.
d. Paul’s blood pressure, digestive processes, the speed of his reactions, show such and such changes.
e. Such and such processes occur in Paul’s central nervous system.”


## Argument for Behaviorism

+ Wittgenstein's beetle in the box. Here is an example. Gaviga. Have every student use it in the group. We want to call things Gaviga. It must be about something on campus.  Have them use it in sentences saying how high and short it looks like. Then ask them whether we are talking about the same thing. We can check whether the word is referring to the same thing. 

+ The argument is from a theory of meaning. Here is something general about meaning. Words have meaning by reference. Sentences have meaning by composition of words. 

+ Verificationists think something else. 
+ I need to talk about observational sentences. 


+ I need to introduce general discussion of meaning. 

+ “The meaning of a statement consists in its method of verification”, Schlick

+ Observational sentences
+ Confirmation--you need to say that in principle something that is confirmable must be confirmable by everyone.
+ Empirically verifiable conditions for individual sentences

+ Ayer in ‘Language, Truth and Logic’ argued “A sentence is only factually significant to a person if he or she knows what observations would lead him to accept the proposition as being true or false.” (3)
+ “No statement which refers to a reality transcending the limits of all possible sense-experience can possible have any literal significance.”(3)

+ In principle vs. in practice

+ S is verifiable then if I can use one of my senses to realise it. But this must be qualified… my eyes must be open, my senses working properly, I am tall enough to see above the table, an evil demon has not made the cat invisible, I am looking in the right direction. The list is endless. 

+ Bachelors are unmarried men+ This is  meaningful for the positivist because it is an analytic truth, somehow true by definition. 
+ Q is meaningful because the terms bachelors and unmarried men are synonymous. 
+ Two terms are synonymous if they are intersubstitutable salva veritate. 

+ But what if two terms are accidentally intersubstitutable salva veritate without being synonymous. of Renate and Cordate as two terms that are accidentally intersubstitutable salva veritate but differ in meaning.

Logical empiricism 

+ something about no progress in many areas in comparison to the sciences. They diagnose the problem in terms of the language used in these debates. They want to say that we are speaking nonsense. 
+ Europe in 20s and 30s. Places like Vienna. Later in the US in the 50s and 60s. 
+ 
+ “1. The meaning of a sentence is given by the conditions that must be verified to obtain if the sentence is true (we may call these “verification conditions”).
2. If a sentence has a meaning that can be shared by different speakers, its verification conditions must be accessible to each speaker—that is, they must be publicly observable.
3. Only behavioral and physical phenomena (including physiological occurrences) are publicly observable.
4. Therefore, the sharable meaning of any psychological sentence must be specifiable by statements of publicly observable verification “conditions, that is, statements describing behavioral and physical conditions that must hold if the psychological statement is true”
