## Grading Rubric

I will grade these essays according to a rubric that you can be find [here.](rubric.pdf) I include here a brief descriptions of the the grading categories. 




**Grasp of the Material:** A very good essay has the following characteristics: 1) it includes the material, and only the material, that is required to address the prompt, 2) it contains no confusions, 3) 
 the material in a way that would be understood by someone who knew no philosophy. 


**Logic Tools:** I will examine how well you understand and deploy the logical tools discussed in Ch.1.3. Here I am primarily looking at your ability to clearly indicate the conclusion and premises of an argument, as well as your ability to assess those arguments. In other words, I'm interested in how well you argue and reason. 
 
**Original Thought:** If you understand the material, you will be able to come up with original examples, present material in new and interesting ways, etc. If you merely repeat the examples in the textbook or the examples used in class, then you are not thinking originally!

**Mechanics:** I will examine whether you have read, understood, and can deploy the lessons of *Appendix B: How to Write a Philosophy Paper* (p.387). I will be assessing a) how well you organize your whole paper---why you make the points you do, and why you present them in the order that you do---, b) how well you organize and write each individual paragraph---each paragraph should contain one distinct point with the other sentences clearly relating to that point, and c) how well you write each sentence.
