\begin{enumerate}
\item My life has meaning only if God exists. 
\item Suicide is never the best choice. 
\item Knowing that I would live just one more day would not undermine my ability to enjoy that day.
\item God exists and watches over me.
\item There is a heaven.
\item It is wrong to criticize other cultures. 
\item It is wrong to judge other people's actions. 
\item The moral principles that I was raised to believe are the right ones. 
\item I make free choices; all my choices are up to me. 
\item My future is completely determined by my past.

\begin{block}{Fundamental vs. Non-Fundamental Beliefs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Your fundamental beliefs are the ones that you use to support other non-fundamental beliefs. 
\item Let us consider two examples, one about health, the other about relationships.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

 \frame{ 
\begin{block}{Reflection Time}
\begin{itemize} 
\item List down some of your fundamental beliefs and how they support some of your non-fundamental beliefs.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}\pause
\begin{block}{Where did these beliefs come from?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can you recall acquiring these beliefs from serious reflection? 
\item Are these beliefs really your own? 
\item Would you have chosen these beliefs if you had been given a choice before they were imposed upon you?  
\item Why do you want to hold on to them?
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
}

   \frame{
   \begin{block}{Liberation}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Philosophy teaches us 1) how to investigate the compatibility between our non-fundamental and fundamental beliefs, that is, it teaches us how to identify what our fundamental beliefs require of us. 2) It teaches us how to investigate our fundamental beliefs.  
   \item As such, philosophy frees us from a sort of dogmatism that would otherwise overtake our minds by passively holding beliefs that we have never examined.
   \item As a result, we become freed from the beliefs that have been forced upon us and come to possess beliefs that we can truly call our own.
