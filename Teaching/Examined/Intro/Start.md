# Course Instructions

## Introduction

Welcome! I'm Dr. Scott O'Connor and I'll be your instructor for this course. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I received a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are ancient philosophy and metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website. 

While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O'Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No 'hey', 'yo', 'what's up', smiley face, etc. See [contact](/Contact) for further information.


## Mechanics

There are two topics each week. You will find these under 'weeks' in Blackboard. Each topic will have the following elements: 

1. Instructions.
2. Notes that partially review the assigned readings.  
3. Assignments.
4. Optional Readings.
5. Media, e.g., video clips, blogs, etc.

You will work through the topics by clicking on 'instructions' and then completing the various elements. Since there are two topics per week, there are two assignments per week, one quiz and one short essay. See the syllabus for the complete requirements. 

## Next Steps 

1. Read the syllabus carefully. Just as you would never take a prescription without reading the instructions first, do not start this course without reading the syllabus first.  
2. Complete Topics 1 and 2 in Week 1.
