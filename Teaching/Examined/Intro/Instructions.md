## Course Instructions

### Introduction

Welcome! I'm Dr. Scott O'Connor and I'll be your instructor this semester. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I received a Masters Degree in Philosophy from Oxford University and a Doctorate Degree in Philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are Ancient Philosophy and Metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website and find a picture of me [here](http://www.njcu.edu/philosophy/faculty/). 

While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O'Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No 'hey', 'yo', 'what's up', smiley face, etc. See [contact](\Contact) for further information.


### Mechanics


This course has several modules, each one lasting 1-3 weeks. You will find links to the modules on this course website and the syllabus. While there are some variations to the modules, each one is built around the following components: 

2. A handout that partially reviews the assigned reading.  
3. An assignment.
4. Optional Readings
5. Media, e.g., video clips, blogs, etc.

### Next Steps 

1. Read the syllabus carefully. Just as you would never take a prescription without reading the instructions first, do not start this course without reading the syllabus first.  
2. Read my brief introduction to philosophy and watch the accompanying video clip. 
3. Visit with me during office hours to ask questions, raise concerns, or just say 'hello'.
4. Complete the reading for our next meeting. See syllabus.
