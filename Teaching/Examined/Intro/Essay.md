### Prompt---A Letter 

An e-mail from the future. Your future self send you an e-mail. It's going to tell you that you are wrong about something. They tell you that you have been living your life believing that something or other is important. Future self tells you how that belief has shaped you, what specific actions it has lead you to take, what big decisions you have made, friends made, jobs taken, opportunities lost, etc. Future self then challenges that held belief. They point to how you never really had a good reason for it and give an argument against it.

### Further Instruction

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
