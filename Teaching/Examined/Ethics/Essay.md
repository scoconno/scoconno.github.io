## Prompt

Kirinyaga essay 



+ Read [‘Kirinyaga’, ch. 1, by Mike Resnik](/Teaching/Examined/Ethics/Kirinyaga.epub) 
	+ **NB:** You will need to open this file with software that can read ePubs. iBooks for macs works great. Calibre for pcs is a good option. Both are free.


## Word Count

500-750. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points. 


## Further Instruction

Evaluating Carol's action with an ethical theory requires you to a) decide whether that theory would judge the action moral, immoral, or neither, and b) explain why the ethical theory would make that evaluation. In doing both, you will need to be as specific as possible. 

Points for this assignment are distributed equally across the two paragraphs.

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 


## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Format
