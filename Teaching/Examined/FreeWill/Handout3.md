## Compatibilism

Recall the Free Will Problem:

1. If a person acts of her own free will, then she could have done otherwise.
2. If determinism is true, no one can do otherwise than one actually does.
3. Therefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free will. 


Causal determinism says that states of the universe, including what you are doing at any particular time, are completely determined by how the universe was in the past, even the far far past, plus the laws of nature. If that is true, then my eating  cake right now was causally determined, it was already set in stone that I would eat it and I had no power to do otherwise.  Our concern in this handout is compatibilism, which tries to reconcile this fact about our actions with free will. It does so by rejecting premise 1 of the above argument. 


While the compatibilist accepts causal determinism, they claim that humans are still morally responsible for their behavior and deserving of blame and punishment. If a person is morally responsible for their behavior, then they must be the source of their own conduct. Compatibilists offer an account of what it means for us to be the source of our own conduct that is supposedly compatible with causal determinism. The first move in motivating compatibilism is to distinguish between two notions of 'free will'. 




**Forking Path view of Free Will (rejected by compatibilists)**

+ An agent has control over her conduct at a moment in time if she has the ability to select among, or choose between, alternative courses of action, i.e., choose between alternative future paths. 


This forking path view of freedom jars with causal determinism. But the compatibilist denies that freedom should be understood along these lines. They instead offer the following account of freedom:  

**Source of Action**

+ An agent freely does F if 1) F arises from her internal states and character, and 2) are not forced by external conditions or agents.

Suppose that I have a very sweet tooth. My having a sweet tooth will cause me to eat the cake. So that action, my eating the cake, in some strong sense comes from me and not the outside; it's because of how I am that I ate the cake. The compatibilist claims that this is all that is required for an action to be free---it arises from inside of you, from your personality, and is not caused by external pressure.   

How do actions arise from our personality? Our personality is made up a variety of different traits like honesty, courage, greed, etc. Some people are honest and courageous. Some are honest, but cowardly. Traits are complex dispositions to think, desire, and act in characteristic ways. To be honest, for instance, is to be disposed to truth-telling, to think well of those who tell the truth, to deliberate about whether you are communicated truthfully, and to act to rectify any possible confusion, e.g., contact someone to ensure you answered their questions truthfully.

Character traits have the following three features: 

1. Robust: an individual with a particular character trait will exhibit trait-relevant behavior across a broad spectrum of trait-relevant situations. Such traits are said to be "robust" traits, e.g., an honest person will tend to tell the truth to friends, family members, co-workers, students, etc. 

2. Stabile: traits are relatively stable over time.  A soldier who behaves courageously for a significant period of time is courageous. A soldier who behaves non-courageously for a significant period of time is not courageous. A soldier will not become or cease to be courageous overnight. 

3. Integrated: there is a correlation between having one trait and having another, e.g., a person who is temperate with regard to the pleasures derived from food is likely to also be temperate with regard to the pleasures derived from sexual intercourse. Likewise, an individual with a particular vice is likely to possess other vices.


 
The compatibilist is committed to the claim that we have character traits that are robust, stable, and integrated with one another. They believe that an action is our own just when it arises from our unique set of traits; if my character traits make me eat the cake, then eating the cake, according to the compatibilist, is free.
