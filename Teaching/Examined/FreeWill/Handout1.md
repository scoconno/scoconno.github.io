## Causal Determinism


**Causal determinism:** given a specified way things are at a time *t*, everything which happens at a time later than t is fixed as a matter of natural law.

**Free Will:** an agent, S, freely chooses to do F at time t1 if and only if it was up to S at time t to bring either F or not F about. 

1. If S freely choose to do F at t1, then S's doing F is not fixed at times earlier than t1.
2. If causal determinism is true, then S's doing F is fixed at times earlier than t1. 
3. If causal determinism is true, then S does not freely choose to do F at t1.
4. Causal determinism is true. 
5. S does not feely choose to do F at t1.

## Compatibilism ##

Compatibilists accept Causal Determinism but they claim that humans are still morally responsible for their behavior and deserving of blame and punishment. If a person is morally responsible for their behavior, then they must have control over their own conduct. Compatibilists offer an alternative account of Free Will that they hope is a) compatible with Causal Determinism, and b) sufficient for moral responsibility. 



+ Causal Determinism: the facts of the past, in conjunction with the laws of nature, entail every truth about the future.

*Argument Against Free-Will*

1. If a person acts of her own free will, then she could have done otherwise.
2. If determinism is true, no one can do otherwise than one actually does.
3. Therefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free will.




**Compatibilists** deny claim 1. They offer an alternative account of Free-Will



**Forking Path (rejected by compatibilists)**

+ An agent has control over her conduct at a moment in time if she has the ability to select among, or choose between, alternative courses of action, i.e., choose between alternative future paths. 

**Source of Action**

+ An agent freely does F if 1) F arises from her internal states and character, and 2) are not forced by external conditions or agents. 

####Problems####

+ Note the distinction between freely *acting* a certain way and freely *choosing* to act a certain way. Compatibilists are claiming you act freely when your actions arises from your character. But can your actions be free if they you did not freely choose them? 
+ Since the Compatibilist accepts Causal Determinism, they accept that your character is determined by the past. 
+ If your character is shaped by circumstances outside your control, are the actions that arise from your character free? 






##Libertarianism##

+ Free Will & Causal Determinism are incompatible. 
+ Free Will requires that we have the power to *choose* between alternative possibilities...(emphasis on freedom of will and not merely of action)
+ Causal Determinism is false.
+ We sometimes act freely. 

**Strategy:** Proper attention to the nature of human persons shows us that our actions are not causally determined. 

###Option 1: Physicalism###

+ Proper attention to physics shows that Causal Determinism is false. 

Classical Physics: exact, simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities, e.g., the position and momentum of a particle. 

Quantum Physics: no exact, simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities, e.g., no exact value can be assigned to both the position and momentum of each particle: the more precisely the position (momentum) of a particle is given, the less precisely can one say what its momentum (position) is. 

Causal Determinism seems to require Classical Physics: the state of the universe is determined by the fixed state of the universe at some previous time plus the law of nature. But Quantum Physics tells us that the state of universe at each time is not totally fixed!!! 

**Problem:** We are not sub-atomic particles. How does the failure of Causal Determinism at the microscopic level, show that Causal Determinism is false at the macroscopic level?


###Option 2: Dualism###

1. The mind/soul/will is not reducible to anything physical.
2. The mind/soul/will is at least partially the cause of some of our actions. 
3. Thus, some of our actions have non-physical causes. 
4. Thus, some of our actions are not causally determined. 

**Problem with 1:** How could a non-physical being be the cause of something physical?
