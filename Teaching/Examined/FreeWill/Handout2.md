## Libertarianism

Recall that the argument against free will relies on two claims, one a general claim that applies to all events in the universe, a second a claim about what free will would require of us. 

Causal determinism:
: Given a specified way things are at a time *t*, everything which happens at a time later than *t* is fixed as a matter of natural law.

Free Will:
: An agent, S, freely chooses to do F at time *t1* if and only if it was S's power at time *t1* to bring either F or not F about. 

Causal Determinism says that states of the universe, including what you are doing at any particular time, are completely determined by how the universe was in the past, even the far far past, plus the laws of nature. If that's true, then anything I do is causally determined, it is already determined how what I will choose and how I will act---I cannot choose otherwise than I do. But Free Will requires that my choices and actions are not determined. It requires that I, myself, have the power to choose otherwise than I do. So, it appears that these two claims are incompatible. 

Libertarians respond by attempting to rescue free will. They do so by rejecting Causal Determinism. They are committed to the following 4 claims: 

1.  Free Will & Causal Determinism are incompatible. 
2.  Free Will requires that we have the power to *choose* between alternative possibilities...(emphasis on freedom of will and not merely of action)
3.  Causal Determinism is false.
4.  We sometimes act freely. 

The key claim is, of course, 3. Libertarians accept that Free Will jars with Causal Determinism, but they take this as evidence that  Causal Determinism is false. They offer two different arguments for 3.  The first argues that humans are not purely physical creatures and that Causal Determinism applies only to purely physical creature. The second argues that proper attention to physics shows that Causal Determinism is false. I will consider both options in reverse order. 

### Option 2-Physicalism

Our first version of Libertarianism claims that proper attention to physics shows that Causal Determinism is false. While they agree that the physics of Newton and his predecessors were deterministic ones, they point out that modern physics are not deterministic. 

According to classical physics, exact, simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities, e.g., at each moment, each particle has an exact position and an exact momentum. 

In contrast, quantum physics says that no exact, simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities, e.g., no exact value can be assigned to both the position and momentum of each particle: the more precisely the position (momentum) of a particle is given, the less precisely can one say what its momentum (position) is. 

Causal Determinism seems to require Classical Physics, which says that  the state of the universe is determined by the fixed state of the universe at some previous time plus the law of nature. But Quantum Physics tells us that the state of universe at each time is not totally fixed!!! 

**Problem:** We are not sub-atomic particles. How does the failure of Causal Determinism at the microscopic level, show that Causal Determinism is false at the macroscopic level?


### Option 2-Dualism

1. The mind/soul/will is not reducible to anything physical.
2. The mind/soul/will is at least partially the cause of some of our actions. 
3. Thus, some of our actions have non-physical causes. 
4. Thus, some of our actions are not causally determined. 

**Problem 1:** How could a non-physical being be the cause of something physical? 

**Problem 2:** What evidence is there that we are non-physical? 

Both problems will be the focus of our next module when we discuss the relationship between mind and body.
