### Prompt 

> Sigh. Another day. Another crime. Another victim. Another trial. Another person set for prison. I've done this court psychologist thing for too long now. I know why they did it. It's not their fault they are they way they are. Nobody ever asked them what kind of person they wanted to be. Here they are a victim to their upbringing, it causing them to do this terrible thing. And what do we do? We blame them for something they had no control over and leave them wasting in a prison. Enough. I'm making a stand. I'll convince this judge that the defendant had no control whatsoever. I don't care if I lose my job. 

You are a psychologist for the NJ court system. Your job is to psychologically assess defendants. You must determine whether they committed the crime of their own free will. You primarily ask why the person has the character traits they have and ask whether their behavior is determined by those character traits. You interview their friends, family, and colleagues. You find out whatever you can about their upbringing and how it shaped the person they are today. You then write a short report to the judge outlining your findings. The odd twist is that today you are determined to prove that the defendant's character is responsible for their action and that they had **no control** over having that character. 

Identify some **real** crime and prepare the psychological report of the defendant for the court. You can find a case by looking at old newspapers. NJ.com and nytimes.com are good places to start. Find out as many details as you can about the defendant. Make some up if you need to. Then prepare a report in which you (1) identify the main features of the person's character, (2) argue that the character arose from their upbringing (make sure to give details, anecdotes, etc), and (3) explain how their particular character explains the crime they committed.

Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
