## Short Writing Assignment 2

### Introduction

There are many claims that you agree with. Many you don't. As a philosopher, your job is to think about the arguments for and against claims. It's not that important whether you believe the conclusions of these argument. What's important is your evaluation of the argument for those conclusions. In order to do that, you need to learn how to think with someone's views, even if they are radically different from your own. So, in this prompt you will be asked to defend the existence of God. Again, it's not important whether you believe that God does or does not exist. What's important is being able to work through the arguments on both sides.  


### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

### Due Date
Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

### Format
Please submit the file as either a word file or simple .rtf file will also suffice.

### Grading
Please find the rubric and explanation of it [here](\Teaching\Grading\).

### Resources
Please find links to writing resources [here](\Teaching\Resources\)

### Word Count

Your submission must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points. 


### Prompt

You are a religious leader concerned about the teaching of evolutionary biology in high schools. You think that only God could explain the existence of life. The local school board is accepting public submissions on the issue. 

Write a short letter to the school Board using the Design Argument (and no other argument) to argue that God exists, i.e., arguing that it is only the existence of God and not the evolutionary biology that explains complexity in nature.

### Further Instruction 

+ This assignment covers material contained in Ch.2.
+ Note that this is a letter. Include all appropriate letter headings, salutations, etc. 
+ The members of the School Board are not philosophers. Your job here is to explain a piece of complex philosophy to smart lay people. Use examples, simple vocabulary, etc. 
+ You are being assessed on how well you understand the Design Argument for God's existence. Using any other argument in your letter will lose you points.
