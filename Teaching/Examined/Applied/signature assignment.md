This assignment will be completed in several parts. Please see the syllabus for the relevant deadline. You will work in groups. Your group will pick a topic from an established list.

1. Is it permissible to abort a fetus?

## 2. First Draft--Research

In the first part of your project, you will be collecting and thinking through the information needed to write your final paper. Decide between yourselves how to fairly proportion the work outlined, but clearly indicate in your submission how you divided up the tasks. Note that you will be grading each others' level participation:  

Applied ethicists are more concerned with particular, practical cases than with more abstract theoretical questions. They want to know how, if at all, a hospital should proportion treatment, whether they should vote to abolish the death penalty, etc. The questions listed above are all hot topics in the United States. Your job will be to answer them as an applied ethicist. In this section, you'll be applying two of the ethical theories we learnt about in Module 6, act and rule utilitarianism, to answer your chosen question. 

1. Outline the legal and regulatory status of your chosen issue. 2-3 pages. NY TIMES
2. Identify and summarize the major public concerns relating to the issue at hand. 2-3 pages NYTIEMS
1. Explain both act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. How are they different? 
2. How would the act utilitarian answer your chosen question?
