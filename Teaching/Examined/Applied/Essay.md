### Prompt 


Applied Ethicists are more concerned with particular, practical cases than with more abstract theoretical questions. They want to know how, if at all, a hospital should distribute donated organs, whether it is permissible to bribe officials in foreign states to do business, etc. The questions listed above are all hot topics in the United States. Your job will be to answer them as an Applied Ethicist. In this first draft,
write three short documents:

1.  After researching articles at www.nj.com from the last 5 years, outline the major downsides and benefits of the current policy governing your chosen issue for society as a whole. What are the likely major downsides and benefits for society as a whole if the  policy is changed? Provide full citations to the newspaper articles. (600–800 words)

2.  After researching articles at www.nj.com, identify some specific individuals who have been affected by your chosen issue. Detail the real life downsides and benefits to everyone involved. What would the benefits and downsides have been if the event had not occurred? Back up your answer with evidence from the newspaper articles. (600–800 words)

3.  Given the information that you presented in the first two parts of your paper, explain your answer to your question.   (600–800 words)
