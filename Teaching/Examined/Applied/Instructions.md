Congratulations on reaching your final week of Persons & Problems. I hope it has introduced to philosophy and inspired you to think through some central philosophical questions. The Philosophy & Religion Department at NJCU offers a variety of courses. If you would like to study philosophy a bit more in depth, then please do consider taking further classes with us. 

Only one more task left---the final paper. Please note that you will complete a final paper instead of completing a final example. You can find the prompt [here.](Essay)
