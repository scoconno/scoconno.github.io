## Presentations

There is no in-person meeting on Wednesday, April 26th. Instead, you will be working on your presentations that begin the following week. You can find the schedule of presentations [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tGob1eYD6Qxo6XNt3-c1bVhFzmWxWTVWkMccWhEMTI/edit?usp=sharing). Those of you who have yet to schedule your presentations, should contact me. You can find full details of the signature assignment [here.](Teaching/Examined/Applied/Essay) Each presentation must include four slides as follows: 

+ Slide 1: introduce your question. Define any relevant terms in the question and say a little about why it is interest. 
+ Slide 2: summary of task 1. 
+ Slide 3: summary of task 2. 
+ Slide 4: summary of task 3. 

## Slide Constructino 

Instead of the slides containing all the information you will present, use the slides as visual cues to structure your discussion. Here are a few main points to remember: 

1. Don't fill your slides with text. 
2. Include at least one striking photo/visual per slide. 
3. Large graphs can also work, but the details must be clear. 
4. Include text in bullet points rather than long paragraphs.

## Oral Presentations

I will be evaluating your presentation on the quality of your slides and on how well you speak about those slides. For some general tips about oral presentations, watch this video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5WT2vweFRY)
