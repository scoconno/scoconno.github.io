\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Final Project}\label{final-project}

This course has a final project instead of a final exam. The project
consists in identifying and researching some current moral controversy.

Pick \textbf{one} of the follow questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Is it permissible to abort a fetus?
\item
  Should a doctor help her ill patient die commit suicide?
\item
  Should we ever execute people for their crimes?
\item
  Should we allow people to reproduce by cloning?
\item
  Should prostitution be legal?
\item
  To what extent should we give to charity?
\item
  Should it be illegal for women to drink and take drugs while pregnant?
\item
  Should recreational drug use be legalized?
\item
  Should employers be required to hire American residents and permanent
  residents over undocumented workers?
\item
  Should we curb climate change for the sake of future generations?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Prompt}\label{prompt}

Applied ethicists are more concerned with particular, practical cases
than with more abstract theoretical questions. They want to know how, if
at all, a hospital should distribute donated organs, whether it is
permissible to bribe officials in foreign states to do business, etc.
The questions listed above are all hot topics in the United States. Your
job will be to answer your question as an applied ethicist. To do so,
you need to think both about the effects your issue has on society as a
whole as well as the effect it has on individuals within that
assignment. Your assignment comes in three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  After researching articles at www.nj.com, identify some specific
  individual who has been affected by your chosen issue. Detail the real
  life downsides and benefits to that person, their friends, and their
  families. What would the benefits and downsides have been if the event
  had not occurred? Back up your answer with evidence from the newspaper
  articles. (400--600 words)
\item
  After researching articles at www.nj.com from the last 5 years,
  outline the major downsides and benefits of the current policy
  governing your chosen issue for society as a whole. What are the
  likely major downsides and benefits for society as a whole if the
  policy is changed? Provide full citations to the newspaper articles.
  (400--600 words)
\item
  Given the information that you presented in the first two parts of
  your paper, state your answer to the question and explain how the
  information from the first two parts of the paper influenced your
  answer. (200--400 words)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Grade Breakdown}\label{grade-breakdown}

This paper is worth 25 points towards your final grade. 5 points will be
awarded towards the first draft of the paper, 5 points towards the
presentation, 5 points towards peer evaluation, and 10 points towards
the final draft.

\subsubsection{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that
you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and
handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials
than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant
overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against
Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you
include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for
the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a
report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your
permanent academic record.

\subsubsection{Late Submissions}\label{late-submissions}

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be
accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra
credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored.
If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of
personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and
submit it early.

\subsubsection{Format}\label{format}

Please submit the file as either a word file or simple .rtf file will
also suffice.
