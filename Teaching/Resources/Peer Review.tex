\subsection{Construction} Identify what the author argues for,  and identify how they structure what they argue for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do they clearly state a thesis that they will argue for?  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Looking only at the introductory paragraph, try to restate their thesis in your own words (1-2 sentences). 
\item Read the full paper then answer this question: does the author argue for the thesis they stated? Or do they actually argue for something else?  Explain.
\end{enumerate}

\item Are the sections of the paper clear?  As you read the paper, do you question, ``What are they doing now?''  ``What's going on?'', or could you follow how they argued throughout?  How could they improve how the paper flows?  Explain.
 
\item  Could they leave out any paragraphs?  Did every paragraph clearly contribute to the overall argument of the paper?  Explain.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Style and Mechanics} Now make sure you understand what the author says in each sentence. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Underline any phrases or full sentences that are awkward or confusing. Suggest how to revise those sentences.
\item Underline the beginning and end of each sentence. Evaluate for cohesiveness. 
\item Underline the topic of each sentence in any paragraph. Evaluate for coherence. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Exposition} Evaluate how the author argues by considering the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Is everything they say accurate?  Point out anything you think the author has misunderstood about the topic. 

\item Does the author say enough so that an intelligent person who has never read about the topic will easily understand what is going on?  What should the author add?  Be specific.

\item  Is there anything they could cut in order to argue some point more fully or better explain some idea?  Be specific.
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsection{Critical Engagement}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  The author uses some argument strategy. Identify and describe it in your own words (1-2 sentences).

\item How effectively does the author execute this strategy?  Did you work hard to figure out what they are doing?  Did you follow along up to a point and then lose track?  Where did you get lost?  Be specific.

\item Do they argue for what they claim, or do they just state their claims without explaining or justifying them?  Be specific. 
 
\item  Should they add anything to fill out what they argue?  Explain.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Success} What do you like about the paper?  What does it do well?  Be specific.
