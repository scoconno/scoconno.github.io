# The Meaning of Life



## Introduction ##


Clarifying the question. 

Life has meaning if it has significant value or purpose over time beyond the good merely being alive. 

Internal vs External Meaning

Internal: meaning or purpose that comes from inside people, that humans can give to themselves. Life can be meaningful for persons if they come to see their goals or purposes as inherently valuable or worthwhile. 

External: Meaning or purpose that comes from outside of humanity. From the perspective of universe what significance does it have. 

So, we might, ask about, say, bees. What purpose or significance does the life of a bee have? From an external point of view, it has significance to, say, bee keepers (career related), honey eaters (sustenance), and so on. From an internal point of view, a bee's life would have meaning if a bee could come to one of its projects as worthwhile. So, for instance, if a worker bee could come to see the project of serving the queen as worthwhile, the bee would find value in life. 

Our question? Does life have either external or internal meaning? Some, like Tolstoy, worry that it has no external meaning. Further, they argue that if it has no external meaning it can have no internal meaning. Tolstoy's main concern was that our death undermined any external meaning our lives might have. As an analogy, one might ask what significance the life of an insect that lasted a second could have for human beings. Others will claim that life can have internal meaning without external meaning. The point, I think, to emphasize is that the issue is about internal meaning. That's what motivates us. Can we find our projects worthwhile. 


## Pessimism ##

I need a diagram of the dragon. I also must have notes on this. 


## Optimism ##

#### Theist #### 

Claim 1: human's life has external meaning only because it is part of God's plan, a grand cosmic order that encompasses every entity in the universe. "We are here to do God's will"

Claim 2: a human's life can have internal meaning if they align their life---their goals, projects, ambitions---with God's plan. You will do this by by performing certain duties or being a certain kind of person. 

Tolstoy---read from 373-374. Stress
1) He thinks the working class have faith, not reason.
2) They all are content that life has meaning.
3) They accept hardships knowing it is for some greater good.
4) Tolstoy, accepting this, has a transformation---read the last paragraph. Recognizing God, he changes his mind on what is worthwhile in life---he finds internal meaning by living in accordance with God's plan.


####Meaning & Christianity####

Christians claim that Jesus lived a meaningful life. The story of his life demonstrates it had two distinct meanings: 

**Teleological Meaning:** life has a purpose. That purpose is a good one. 

God sent his only son to save humans. All of Jesus' life involve suffering for the sake of us. So, we can think about all the aspects of his life as being organized by this one overarching purpose. Ask students to spell this out. 

**Axiological meaning:** life has some good for you.  


One way something can have meaning is to refer to something else---to be about something else e.g., a narrative has meaning. 

A human life can be a narrative that has meaning. 

Christianity care about history. It has meaningful narratives. The story of Jesus is a a meaningful narrative for Christians. 

Jesus shows us that God cares about human lives. Humans matter to God.

Jesus story can be a paradigm for believers to follow. Jesus's life has meaning. What about us?  

 Christianity also tells tales which emphasize what God has done for humans, they make it clear that those actions are important from God's point of view. 
 
- Narrative reveal some of Gods purposes for both individual humans and humanity as a whole.Think about Noah, different saints, etc.  

#### Objection ####

What is this purpose? 

Suggestions 1: Our purpose is to serve God.

Objections:
1) Our lives have a purpose for God, but not for us. Similarly, bees have a purpose for the bee keeper, but that doesn't show it has a purpose for the bees. 

--- Suppose that God created us to be the food for some other species. We would now have a role in his grand design, but would this be sufficient to address Tolstoy's concerns? 

2) This fits uneasily with God being all good---why create us as suffering, complex beings only to serve him? If we could create a new species of animal to feed us, would we create them to suffer and toil in their serving of us? 

Suggestion 2: The existence of God shows that we have a purpose since he wouldn't have created us without a purpose.That purpose is not to serve God, but we don't know what it is.

--- Again, what if this purpose is not one we are pleased with? 






#### Meaning without God ####

Wolf begins by asking â€˜What do we mean by â€˜the meaning of lifeâ€™?+ If we take the question â€˜What is the meaning of life?â€™ to be asking â€˜What is the purpose behind our existence?â€™, then Wolf thinks that this question is (too) easily answered. If God (or some other creator) exists, then perhaps God had some reason for creating us; however, if God doesnâ€™t exist, then there is simply no reason that we exist.+ Wolf thinks, however, that even though the question of the meaning of life is easily answeredâ€”there is a distinct question of whether or not individual lives are meaningful.+ Wolf wants to give an account of what it is that makes an individual life meaningful.
+ She begins by shooting down an alternate account. She doesnâ€™t think that a life is meaningful iff it satisfies a subjective criteria like making the person happy.
+ Paradigm cases of meaningful livesâ€”Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Einstein, for example are not particularly happy lives.+ Additionally, paradigm cases of meaningless lives-The Blob, for example-are actually filled with a good amount of subjective happiness and contentedness.+ Wolfâ€™s account: a meaningful life is one that is actively and at least somewhat successfully engaged in a project (or projects) of positive value.
+ She asks us to consider the cases of people whose lives are useless due to a lack of activity: The Blob and the idle rich. 
+ From these, she asks us to conclude, with her, that a meaningful life must be one of active engagement.+ She next asks us to consider cases in which a life, though actively engaged, is wasted on a project without any positive value: the corporate executive and the pig farmer. From these, she asks us to conclude, with her, that a meaningful life is one whose projects are of some positive value.+ Finally, she presents cases in which the project around which somebody has organized their life is revealed to be bankrupt-the scientist whose break-through is scooped, for instance. She thinks that this, too, renders a life meaningless. So she requires that the projects be successful. + `Projectsâ€™ should be taken broadly to include any kind of ongoing activity or involvement.+ So, too, should the projects engage the person â€” they should see them as constituting part of what their life is about. The projects must actually have positive value. It is not enough that the individual believes that their projects have positive value. Else, we could not make sense of awakenings in which somebody comes to realize that their life to date has been without meaning, since their projects lack any positive value. Since, then, what the person would supposedly realize would be that their life hasnâ€™t seemed meaningful--but surely, thatâ€™s not what people are realizing in such awakenings.
+ The positive value need not be moral value. Having given an account of what people want when they want meaning in their lives, Wolf next considers whether or not meaning is something that we ought to want in our lives. Reasons for doubt:
+ meaningful lives are not necessarily moral lives, nor do they necessarily make the lives of others betterâ€”nor do they necessarily make the person whose life is meaningful better off.
+ Wolfâ€™s answer: we should want our lives to be actively engaged with projects of positive objective valueâ€”as opposed to projects which are merely subjectively valuableâ€”because to do otherwise is to fail to recognize that one is but a small speck in a vast, value-filled universe. It is to fail to recognize that many things besides oneâ€™s own life have objective value.
+ That you are just a speck in a vast, value-filled universe provides you with a reason (an objective reason) to value something besides yourself.+ To be devoted merely to your own happiness is to fail to recognize that things besides yourself have value. It is to act â€˜as ifâ€™ you are the only valuable thing in existence.  To lead a meaningful life, on the other hand, is to acknowledge that you are just a speck in a vast, value-filled universe. It is to live a life that accords with the facts.

Internal meaning without external meaning

I need to write out this more. 

MLK, Gandhi, Socrates, and so on. 

The life of S has meaning if S devoted himself to a cause, or acquired meaning if S became sufficient attached to a cause. 

1) Life had some dominant, over-all goal which gave direction to a great many of the individual's actions. 

2) Actions were performed with a special zest that was not present before the person became attached to his goal or would not have been present if that person had no such goal.
