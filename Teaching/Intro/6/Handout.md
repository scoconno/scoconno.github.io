# The Meaning of Life


###  Personal Resources

We will be talking about death, suicide, and depression in this module. These are uncomfortable topics for many and have touched most of us directly or indirectly. They raise core philosophical questions, perhaps raise the most important philosophical questions. I would like to encourage you to keep a very open mind about the material, certainly don't accept that, say, you are better off being dead after a few days of reading about it. A full and proper study of the issues would take many years. 

### Introduction 

You are mortal. Your friends, families, and loved ones are mortal. Each of us will die. It is easy to ignore our mortality. We often think of death has happening some time away in the future. Like a distant land that we may have to visit one day, that land is not this land and we push it off. We may hope for a long lived life, but death is an ever pressing possibility. Several people have recently died from Legionnaires disease in the Bronx. Many die from car accidents. Bizarre accidents too. You don't think that when you wake up, that this might be the day you die. It's too depressing! You might stumble and hit your temples and die from an accident. Here we are going to see some arguments that our mortality robs our life of meaning. Suicide. Why live? You may worry about family and friends. But they too will die. From the perspective of the universe, our lives are insignificant. 


Part V

... My question - that which at the age of fifty brought me to the verge of suicide - was the simplest of questions, lying in the soul of every man from the foolish child to the wisest elder: it was a question without an answer to which one cannot live, as I had found by experience. It was: "What will come of what I am doing today or shall do tomorrow? What will come of my whole life?"

Differently expressed, the question is: "Why should I live, why wish for anything, or do anything?" It can also be expressed thus: "Is there any meaning in my life that the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?"  ...
I will first clarify the question. The handout proceeds in two. The first part pessimism looks at argument that life has no meaning. The second, optimism, tries to respond to the pessimism and identify a meaning to life. 
Clarifying the question. The question that concerns us, `what's the meaning of life?' seems a good one. It's certainly one you can imagine anyone, philosopher or not, raising and trying to answer. However, the question is itself misleading and any hope of answering it will require that we identify what exactly it is asking. 

Why is it misleading? `Meaning' is a property of words and phrases. You can ask about the meaning of, say, 'cacophony', but you cannot ask about the meaning of, say, the sun. The sun is physical entity. Physical entities do  not have meanings at all. 

When we ask after the meaning of life, we are not concerned with the meaning of the word 'life'. Answering the question would then just require us to consult the relevant entry in a dictionary. We are asking something deeper, something about why we should live at all. The question arises, on the one hand, because we find ourselves on this Earth alive, living a life, having never chosen to in fact be alive. On the other hand, we find ourselves with lives that can be ended at any moment we chose. Similarly, suppose you woke up at a party after being knocked out and brought there without your input. However, you can leave the party at any time. It's completely up to you. If you stay, you should have a reason for staying. Might you be better of leaving? Similarly, none of us chose to live, but we can all end our lives at any moment. If we chose not to leave, not to end our lives, we should have a reason for our choice. Why is living better than dying?  

Understood in this way, life has meaning only if it has significant value or purpose over time, where this value makes life choice worthy, i.e., making living something that is reasonable for us to continue with. 

While reshaping the question in this way, we still need to decide what kind of value we are seeking when we ask what value, if any, being alive has. Philosophers here like to distinguish between *internal* and *external meaning*. 

+ **Internal:** the value or purpose that comes when people see their goals or purposes as inherently valuable or worthwhile. 

+ **External:** Meaning or purpose that comes from outside of humanity. From the perspective of universe what significance does it have. 

Let us illustrate the difference What purpose or significance does the life of a bee have? From an external point of view, it has significance to bee keepers and honey eaters. For the former, bees are significant for their career. For the latter, bees are significant because they produce the stuff they feed on. From an internal point of view, a bee's life would have meaning if a bee could come to see one of its projects as worthwhile, if it come to value some project. So, for instance, if a worker bee could come to see the project of serving the queen as worthwhile, the bee would find value in its life. 

When we ask why we should keep living, we are primarily asking about internal value. We are asking why we should feel that there is something in our lives that make them worthwhile. In other words, we are asking why we should feel motivated to get up in the morning and do something rather than nothing. What can we focus our energy and attention on to keep going? 

Our question? Does life have either external or internal meaning? Some, like Tolstoy, worry that it has no external meaning. Further, they argue that if it has no external meaning it can have no internal meaning. Tolstoy's main concern was that our death undermined any external meaning our lives might have. As an analogy, one might ask what significance the life of an insect that lasted a second could have for human beings. Others will claim that life can have internal meaning without external meaning. The point, I think, to emphasize is that the issue is about internal meaning. That's what motivates us. Can we find our projects worthwhile. 
 
 Distinguish the question whether life is valuable from the question whether things like education or health are valuable. Tolstoy ultimately wants to argue that none of these things in a life or valuable if life as such is not valuable.   It is not a question as to whether, say, an education is valuable. 
### Pessimism

One of the best know arguments that life has no meaning comes from Leo Tolstoy. Something about our life. 


1. Life is choice worthy only if it has internal meaning. 2. Life has internal meaning only if life has external meaning. 3. Life has no external meaning. 4. Life has no internal meaning. 5. Life is not choice worthy. Tolstoy motivates his argument by way of a fable:
> Imagine a traveller fleeing a ferocious, hungry beast. Our traveller's only means of escape is a well they stumble on. They jump down to escape the infuriated beast who remains waiting at the well's edge. Some great trees grow beside our well, their roots jutting down and through its walls. The traveller reaches out, grabs the roots and saves himself from falling, which turns out quite fortuitous for him. As his eyes adjust, the traveller notices red glowing eyes at the bottom of the well. A dragon! 
Our traveler is stuck. The beast above awaits if he climbs. The dragon below awaits if he climbs down. He pauses, clutching the roots growing from the cleft of the well wall. Things get worse. Two mice, one black one white, appear and start nibbling on the roots, which will inevitable break. Our traveller realizes that inevitable fall into the dragon's jaws below. While he is still clinging, he sees some drops of honey hanging on the roots, and so reaches out for them with his tongue and tastes the sweetness that distracts him from the beast above, the dragon below, and the mice wearing down the roots.  

This fable, says Tolstoy, depicts the life each of us life. The dragon and beast represent death. The mice represent time. The honey represents those things we use to distract ourselves from our mortality. He claims: "Just so I hold on to the branch of life, knowing that the dragon of death is waiting inevitably for me, ready to tear me to pieces, and I cannot understand why I have fallen on such suffering. And I try to lick that honey which used to give me pleasure, but now it no longer gives me joy, and the white and black mouse day and night nibble at the branch to which I am holding on. I clearly see the dragon, and the honey is no longer sweet to me. I see only the inevitable dragon and the mice, and am unable to turn my glance away from them. This is not a fable, but a veritable, indisputable, comprehensible truth."" 


The honey is anything you might enjoy, family, career, etc. Tolstoy suggests that it's inevitable fact of our psychologies and circumstances that we will come to recognize our mortality. He may also be making the stronger claim that each of us is unconsciously aware of our own death and frantically seeking distractions. These are  supposed to be what give our lives internal value, they are the things that make us thin that life is choice worthy. The issue is that they are fickle. 
Tolstoy reports that ''The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me...The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and of writing - art as I called it - were no longer sweet to me.''
Family: 

"Family"...said I to myself. But my family - wife and children - are also human. They are placed just as I am: they must either live in a lie or see the terrible truth. Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them, I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge leads them to the truth. And the truth is death....No sweetness of honey could be sweet to me when I saw the dragon and saw the mice gnawing away my support.


Art: 
The art is temporal. It may last a few years after his death. But it will not last forever. Eventually nothing will survive of him. 



It was indeed terrible. And to rid myself of the terror I wished to kill myself. ...



### Four Attitudes Toward Death
1. Ignorance: It consists in not knowing, not understanding, that life is an evil and an absurdity. People of this sort have yet to  see the dragon that awaits them nor the mice gnawing the shrub by which they are hanging, and they lick the drops of honey, but they lick those drops of honey only for a while: something will turn their attention to the dragon and the mice, and there will be an end to their licking. From them I had nothing to learn - one cannot cease to know what one does know.
3. Epicureanism: while knowing the hopelessness of life, make use meanwhile of the advantages one has, disregarding the dragon and the mice, and licking the honey in the best way, especially if there is much of it within reach. But many people don't have much honey to taste, i.e., they live in terrible conditions. It is a mere accident, claims Tolstoy, that you have good circumstances rather than poor, and ''the accident that has today made me a Solomon may tomorrow make me a Solomon's slave.'' These people  forget the things that gave Buddha no peace - the inevitability of sickness, old age, and death, which today or tomorrow will destroy all these pleasures.

4. Weakness: It consists in seeing the truth of the situation and yet clinging to life, knowing in advance that nothing can come of it. People of this kind know that death is better than life, but not having the strength to act rationally - to end the deception quickly and kill themselves - they seem to wait for something. This is the escape of weakness, for if I know what is best and it is within my power, why not yield to what is best? 
3. Suicide: This is the way of strength and energy. It consists in destroying life, when one has understood that it is an evil and an absurdity. A few exceptionally strong and consistent people act so. Having understood the stupidity of the joke that has been played on them, and having understood that it is better to be dead than to be alive, and that it is best of all not to exist, they act accordingly and promptly end this stupid joke. (Why is it a joke?)
##### Tolstoy's SolutionA. God Laws - God's purpose more generally. The meaning of life is to be found in the fact that God has a purpose for us.
B. Eternal bliss, paradise (or the opposite). The meaning of this life is a matter of its being preparation for the next life.





## Optimism ##

#### Theist #### 

Claim 1: human's life has external meaning only because it is part of God's plan, a grand cosmic order that encompasses every entity in the universe. "We are here to do God's will"

Claim 2: a human's life can have internal meaning if they align their life---their goals, projects, ambitions---with God's plan. You will do this by by performing certain duties or being a certain kind of person. 

Tolstoy---read from 373-374. Stress
1) He thinks the working class have faith, not reason.
2) They all are content that life has meaning.
3) They accept hardships knowing it is for some greater good.
4) Tolstoy, accepting this, has a transformation---read the last paragraph. Recognizing God, he changes his mind on what is worthwhile in life---he finds internal meaning by living in accordance with God's plan.


####Meaning & Christianity####

Christians claim that Jesus lived a meaningful life. The story of his life demonstrates it had two distinct meanings: 

**Teleological Meaning:** life has a purpose. That purpose is a good one. 

God sent his only son to save humans. All of Jesus' life involve suffering for the sake of us. So, we can think about all the aspects of his life as being organized by this one overarching purpose. Ask students to spell this out. 

**Axiological meaning:** life has some good for you.  


One way something can have meaning is to refer to something else---to be about something else e.g., a narrative has meaning. 

A human life can be a narrative that has meaning. 

Christianity care about history. It has meaningful narratives. The story of Jesus is a a meaningful narrative for Christians. 

Jesus shows us that God cares about human lives. Humans matter to God.

Jesus story can be a paradigm for believers to follow. Jesus's life has meaning. What about us?  

 Christianity also tells tales which emphasize what God has done for humans, they make it clear that those actions are important from God's point of view. 
 
- Narrative reveal some of Gods purposes for both individual humans and humanity as a whole.Think about Noah, different saints, etc.  

#### Objection ####

What is this purpose? 

Suggestions 1: Our purpose is to serve God.

Objections:
1) Our lives have a purpose for God, but not for us. Similarly, bees have a purpose for the bee keeper, but that doesn't show it has a purpose for the bees. 

--- Suppose that God created us to be the food for some other species. We would now have a role in his grand design, but would this be sufficient to address Tolstoy's concerns? 

2) This fits uneasily with God being all good---why create us as suffering, complex beings only to serve him? If we could create a new species of animal to feed us, would we create them to suffer and toil in their serving of us? 

Suggestion 2: The existence of God shows that we have a purpose since he wouldn't have created us without a purpose.That purpose is not to serve God, but we don't know what it is.

--- Again, what if this purpose is not one we are pleased with? 






#### Meaning without God ####

Wolf begins by asking ‘What do we mean by ‘the meaning of life’?+ If we take the question ‘What is the meaning of life?’ to be asking ‘What is the purpose behind our existence?’, then Wolf thinks that this question is (too) easily answered. If God (or some other creator) exists, then perhaps God had some reason for creating us; however, if God doesn’t exist, then there is simply no reason that we exist.+ Wolf thinks, however, that even though the question of the meaning of life is easily answered—there is a distinct question of whether or not individual lives are meaningful.+ Wolf wants to give an account of what it is that makes an individual life meaningful.
+ She begins by shooting down an alternate account. She doesn’t think that a life is meaningful iff it satisfies a subjective criteria like making the person happy.
+ Paradigm cases of meaningful lives—Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Einstein, for example are not particularly happy lives.+ Additionally, paradigm cases of meaningless lives-The Blob, for example-are actually filled with a good amount of subjective happiness and contentedness.+ Wolf’s account: a meaningful life is one that is actively and at least somewhat successfully engaged in a project (or projects) of positive value.
+ She asks us to consider the cases of people whose lives are useless due to a lack of activity: The Blob and the idle rich. 
+ From these, she asks us to conclude, with her, that a meaningful life must be one of active engagement.+ She next asks us to consider cases in which a life, though actively engaged, is wasted on a project without any positive value: the corporate executive and the pig farmer. From these, she asks us to conclude, with her, that a meaningful life is one whose projects are of some positive value.+ Finally, she presents cases in which the project around which somebody has organized their life is revealed to be bankrupt-the scientist whose break-through is scooped, for instance. She thinks that this, too, renders a life meaningless. So she requires that the projects be successful. + `Projects’ should be taken broadly to include any kind of ongoing activity or involvement.+ So, too, should the projects engage the person — they should see them as constituting part of what their life is about. The projects must actually have positive value. It is not enough that the individual believes that their projects have positive value. Else, we could not make sense of awakenings in which somebody comes to realize that their life to date has been without meaning, since their projects lack any positive value. Since, then, what the person would supposedly realize would be that their life hasn’t seemed meaningful--but surely, that’s not what people are realizing in such awakenings.
+ The positive value need not be moral value. Having given an account of what people want when they want meaning in their lives, Wolf next considers whether or not meaning is something that we ought to want in our lives. Reasons for doubt:
+ meaningful lives are not necessarily moral lives, nor do they necessarily make the lives of others better—nor do they necessarily make the person whose life is meaningful better off.
+ Wolf’s answer: we should want our lives to be actively engaged with projects of positive objective value—as opposed to projects which are merely subjectively valuable—because to do otherwise is to fail to recognize that one is but a small speck in a vast, value-filled universe. It is to fail to recognize that many things besides one’s own life have objective value.
+ That you are just a speck in a vast, value-filled universe provides you with a reason (an objective reason) to value something besides yourself.+ To be devoted merely to your own happiness is to fail to recognize that things besides yourself have value. It is to act ‘as if’ you are the only valuable thing in existence.  To lead a meaningful life, on the other hand, is to acknowledge that you are just a speck in a vast, value-filled universe. It is to live a life that accords with the facts.

Internal meaning without external meaning

I need to write out this more. 

MLK, Gandhi, Socrates, and so on. 

The life of S has meaning if S devoted himself to a cause, or acquired meaning if S became sufficient attached to a cause. 

1) Life had some dominant, over-all goal which gave direction to a great many of the individual's actions. 

2) Actions were performed with a special zest that was not present before the person became attached to his goal or would not have been present if that person had no such goal.
