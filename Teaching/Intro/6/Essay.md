##Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare these essays by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking exam scripts for significant overlaps as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.

##Prompt 

Flex your imagination. You are a disembodied soul that has yet to see this world. You know nothing about what life you may live. You know nothing about what talents you might be born with, whether you will be able or disabled, advantaged or disadvantaged. The only thing you are aware of are two angels somewhere nearby. You have a choice to make. You can choose a body, to be born, live a life and die. Or you can choose to fade away into the peaceful nothingness from which you emerged. The angels disagree about what you should do. One tries to convince you that life is meaningless, that you are better off being nothing at all than a being who is born, lives a while, and dies. The other disagrees. You should choose life, they claim. For it is, they say, something full of meaning and purpose. 

Write a dialogue between you and these two angels. In the mouth of the first angel, explain Tolstoy's initial argument that life is meaningless. In the mouth of the second, explain Tolstoy's subsequent conversion and argument that life is meaningful. Finally, in your own words, choose between life and nothing and explain your choice to the angels. Tell them why you found one argument convincing, the other not. 


## Further Instruction

+ This essay covers material contained in ch.8.1---8.3 and Handout 6. 
+ Note that this is a dialog. Imagine the way dialogs go. There is some back and forth. There is humor. There are jibes. There are serious moments and light moments. Your submission should be written accordingly. Give your characters names.  See any play for some ideas on format. 
+ Allow your characters to question each other, rebut each other, etc.
+ In explaining the argument that life is meaningless, make sure that the angel uses Tolstoy's fable of the cave. 
+ In explaining his subsequent claim that life is meaningful, be as specific as you can in explaining *what* that meaning consists in. 
+ Your choice should be guided by your evaluation of the two arguments. Don't say which conclusion you accept. This part of your argument should focus on assessing the logic and premises of the respective arguments.
