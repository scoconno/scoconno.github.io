## Instructions

### Congratulations!

We've reached the end of the course. I enjoyed it. I hoped you did too. If you would like to take more philosophy courses, please see NJCU's Philosophy Department website [here.](http://www.njcu.edu/philosophy/) 


### Assignments

+ Final Essay submitted through Blackboard by **Thursday** Aug., 20th @ 1:00pm. Note that the due date is Thursday and not Monday. 
+ There is no quiz or new reading this week.

### Grades
NJCU is upgrading its Blackboard infrastructure from the 25th-27th. Grades for the final essay and course  will be available as soon as that upgrade is complete. Expect them no later than Aug., 29th.  


### Communication
This course concludes Aug. 20th. I will respond promptly to messages, emails before that date, after which other commitments will take priority for me. Expect to wait up to a week for a response to communication initiated after the 20th.
