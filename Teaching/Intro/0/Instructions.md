### Introduction ###

Welcome to Philosophy 101! I'm Dr. Scott O'Connor and I'll be your instructor for the next 7 weeks. A little about me. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I completed a Masters Degree in Philosophy at Oxford and a Doctorate from Cornell. My areas of specialization are Ancient Philosophy and Metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on my [website](http://scottoconnor.org) and find a picture of me [here](http://www.njcu.edu/philosophy/faculty/). 

While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O'Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in communication with me. No 'hey', 'yo', 'whats up', smiley face, etc. 

### Syllabus ###

You will find the syllabus in this module. Compare a syllabus to the rules of the roads. Before you start learning to drive, you study the book containing those rules. During your driving test, you will be expected to know the rules. Your tester will never take 'I didn't read the book' as an excuse. Likewise, the syllabus outlines the essential workload, policies, and due dates for this course. Before you do anything else, read the syllabus carefully. If you have questions, please message me through Blackboard. 

### Mechanics ###

This course has 7 modules. Each module will become available on the first day of the week, e.g., Week 1 becomes available on day 1, which is Monday, July 6th. Week 2 becomes available on July 13th, and so on. Apart from Week 7, you will have 1 week to complete each module. While there are some variations in the modules, each one is built around the following components: 

1. Instructions for that module. 
2. A handout that reviews that assigned reading. 
3. A multiple choice reading quiz. Once you start you have 60 consecutive minutes to complete it. 
4. Public office hours: a discussion board in which you can ask questions about course content and mechanics. Your questions and my responses are public. 

In addition, modules may also include: 

1. A video clip. 
2. A discussion question. 
3. An essay question. 


### Next Steps ###

1. Again, read the syllabus carefully. Just as you would never take a prescription without reading the instructions first, do not start this course without reading the syllabus first.  
2. Read my brief introduction to philosophy and watch the accompanying video clip.
