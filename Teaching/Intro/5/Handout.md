Introduction

## Theory 1: Consequentialism

### Introduction

![alt text](/Teaching/Intro/4/Slide1.jpg)

The Principle of Utility: Rights actions are those that result in greater overall well-being (or utility) for the people involved than any other possible actions. 

+ Denies any absolute moral rules. An action might me moral in one circumstance, but not another---draw up on the board an arrow for an action, a picture of the actor, and then one box for good effects, another box for bad effects. Then consider one situation where the act results in more good effects over bad. 

+ We'll focus on Bentham's simpler view: well-being is the good effect. Pain is the bad. Point out that we are assuming we quantify pain. There is different units of pleasure and pain. 

1. Clarification: this is impartial--maximize well-being for everyone involved, not just yourself. 
2. Maximize units of pleasure regardless of the distribution of the units. 
3. We are asked to compare alternative actions: option 1 might result in 10 units of pain and 90 units of pleasure. Option 2 results in 20 units of pain and 80 of pleasure. Option 3 results in a 50/50 split. The right action is option 1: of all our alternatives, it has the highest ration of pleasure to pain. 

**Rule vs. Act Utilitarianism**

- Act: rightness and wrongness of an action depends solely on the overall well-being produced by individual actions---right if in a particular situation it produces a greater balance of well-being over suffering than any alternative action---determining rigthness is a matter of weighing the effects of each possible act.  

- Rule: rightness and wrongness are determined on rules governing acts---a right action is one that conforms to a rule that, if followed consistently, would create for everyone involved the most beneficial balance of well-being over sufferieng. Adhere to the rules because in the long run the rules maximize well-being for eveyrone considered---a particular act may produce bad effects in a particular situation. 


3. Let's consider our torture case, 24. I want you to put on your utilitarian hat---doesn't matter if you don't believe it. It's make belief time. Now try to imagine the possible effects in terms of pleasure and pain in the following cases: Option 1- you torture the captive's family, find information, and save 8million lives. Option 2 - you don't torture. You don't find the information. [Maybe change to a police and coerction case] 
	+ Do this first as an act utilitarian. 
	+ Now think of this as a rule utilitarian. You are asked about the effects of two possible rules. Rule 1) You can never torture for information. 2) You can torture for information. What effect would this have on our world? 

4. Let's consider a doctor decidign whether to help a patient to die. The doctor will keep it secret to avoid prosecution. The patient is terminal, elderly, has their mental capacities, the family and friends are struggling for last several years to help elderly patient. 
	+ Compare first two options for how the doctor could act. Option 1: doctor does help. Option 2: doctor does not help. Again, your job here is to focus on this specific action It's unlikely that this one case will have much impact on the field of medicine, or the relationship between doctors and patients. 
	+ Compare two options as a rule: euthanasia is allowed. Euthenasia is not allowed. 
	
	
	
#### Objections####

+ Pleasure is too naieve. 
+ Mill offers an alternative. 
+ Legitimizes strange things. 










# Deontology

## Introduction


The consequentialist looked to the effect box. Deonoglogist says that we should look neither to the actor or the effects of their action to determine the morality of those actions. 

To introduce you to this view, it's important to distinguish between two types of value, innherent vs. relational value. Something like money has only relational value. It is valuable only in relation to what you can buy with it. Health, on the other hand, is valuable in and of itself. You wouldn't seek money if it was impossible to use it for anything. You would seek health even if you couldn't use it for anything else. 

+ Consequentialists think that actions are only right or wrong relationally, i.e., in relation to the effects they produce. The consequentialists can think that the same action performed at different times can vary in whether it is right or wrong. 

+ Kant thinks that actions are right or wrong independently of their effects, production of happiness, people's aims, or their desires and feelings. 

	+ Sam stole the bread to feed his family. Good intentions. Consequentialist might say that this is permissible. Kant would claim that Sam's intentions are irrelevant to whether his actions are right or wrong. 

* Right actions are those actions that are right in themselves because they are consistent with universal moral rules derived from reason. 

The actions have moral worth only if we do them out of a sense of duty, simply because they are our duty. 


#### Categorical Imperatives ####

Moral duties are expressed in the form of categorical imperatives. 

+ An imperative is a command to do something.
+ It is categorical if it applies without exception and without regard to particular needs or purposes. 

Kant Identified a number of imperatives:

1. I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law. 
2. Act to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of another, as an end and never merely as a means. 

**First Imperative**

+ Actions have logical implications-they imply general rules of conduct. 
+ If we can will it, then it is permissible. If not, it is immoral. 
+ Duties include prohibition against killing the innocent, lying, committing suicide, failing to help others when feasible. 


Example: 
If you tell a lie for financial gain, you are acting according to a maxim like 'it's ok to lie'. Can we will that this law becomes a universal law applicable to everyone, i.e., everyone could consistently act on the maxim. No! Lying is possible only if we assume that telling the truth is the norm, i.e., I can only trick you into thinking I'm telling the truth if it would well, be a trick. 


Ask students!

**Second Formulation**

+ People are ends in themselves. 
+ This derives from their nature as autonomous, rational beings capable of directing their own lives, determining their own ends, and decreeing their own rules by which to live. 
+ We treat people as means if we ignore these aspects of their personhood, e.g, coercing them, lying, undermining their rational decision making features, discriminate against them. 
+ Note that you can use people as a means, but you cannot use them only as a means. 


**Examples**

+ Symbiosis. One nation is treating the other as only a means; they lie, deceive, get them drugged up, etc.
+ I, Borg---you might think that they undermine Hugh's decision making capacity. 
+ Slavery
+ Prostitution

**Disagreements between Consequentialist and Deontologist**

Ebola. Is it permissible to force a person into quarantine? Think of typhoid Mary here. 

Lying to public about a NSA operation, or something similar.   




## Virtue Ethics ##


## Introduction ##

We'll begin by looking again at our person, action, effect. The two theories we looked at are action orientated. They say that our goal is to figure out the rightness and wrongness of an action independently of any facts about the person. Their intent, whether their heart was in the right place, etc. It doesn't tell you much about what sort of person to be. Virtue ethics is different. It  says that an action is right iff a virtuous person would do it. 

On this view, your job is to become a type of person. 

Introduce Aristotle. Macedonian writing in Greek. Moved to Athens. Studied with Plato. Set up Lyceum. He was born in 384. Next year is the 2400th anniversary. The disciplines we have come from him. The university comes from the study of him. Goes all around the world. When we are dressed in weird robes in India, we are part of a heritage that traces their roots back to him. Put up a picture. 



## Character Traits ##

+ Virtue does not equal christian virtue like patiences and chastity.  
+ Virtuous person is one who has the virtues.
+ Virtues are character traits. They are multi track dispositions. They are disposition to think, feel, and act in certain ways. Emphasize emotion. 
+ We'll need to figure out which traits are vices and which are virtues, but let's make some assumptions. 
+ Look at different virtues and vices. Honesty. I'll act honest, but I'll also have certain reaction to movies. I'll react certain ways to dishonest people and so on. I'll be drawn towards certain careers, and away from others. 
+ Laziness. I'll love seeing people succeed easily. I'll be annoyed by A type personalities.
+ Ask them to do courage and jealousy. 
+ We said you needed to become a type of person. What does that mean? You need to develop these traits. This can be really hard to do. You can't just will it. You may need therapy. You may need exposure therapy. But you've got to do it. 

## How do we select Character traits?##

+ Aristotle thought that the traits that were virtues are those that allow you to flourish as a human being. 
+ So, if we can figure out what it is to flourish, we'll figure out what traits to acquire. 
+ He says that x flourishes by realizing it's function. 
+ So a good knife vs a poor knife. 
+ A knife's job is to cut. 
+ It needs sharpness to cut. 
+ So sharpness is the virtue of a knife. It's what allows it perform its function well. 
+ What is our characteristic activity? It's to reason. Only we seem capable of deliberating on what kind of life to live and how to figure out how to live that life. So, virtue are those traits that allow us reason well. They are cognitive virtues. 
+ What do you think helps us reason well? Get suggestions from people.
