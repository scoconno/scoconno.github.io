# Discussion Question 3

## Introduction 

'The Walking Dead' is a piece of science fiction. It depicts a post-apocalyptic future where zombies run amok and survivors bandy together for mutual protection. Since fiction often provides such extreme cases, it can be useful to help us clarify the ethical theories that we are discussing this week. We can ask how an ethical theory would judge the act depicted in the show. 

In this [short clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbn1wELZlB8), Carol, one of the main characters, makes a difficult choice. She kills Lizzie, a girl who Carol had become a mother to. Lizzie had suffered a serious psychiatric break. She considered the zombies to be misunderstood creatures, different from humans, but still alive and entitled to be treated with respect. This belief led Lizzie to risk the lives of those around her culminating in her decision to try turn a friend into a zombie. After unsuccessfully trying to help Lizzie, Carol feels forced to kill her. You can get some background [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GitS306EyBQ) This week your job will be to decide how each of the ethical theories would judge Carol's action.


## Prompt

Write three short paragraphs evaluating Carol's behavior. In the first paragraph, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Consequentialist. In the second, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Deontologist. In the third, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Virtue Ethicists. 

## Further Instruction

Using an ethical theory to evaluate an action requires you to a) decide whether that theory would judge the action moral, immoral, or neither, and b) explain why the ethical theory would make that evaluation. In doing both, you will need to be as specific as possible. 

Points for this assignment are distributed equally across the three paragraphs---a third of the points per paragraph. To receive full points for a paragraph, you must complete both a) and b) for each theory.
