## Common Comments and their Abbreviations

Below is a list of abbreviations that I use when grading papers or essay exams. I won't correct every instance of an error, or indeed every error. For instance, if I point to a word that you need to define, I may not point to every other word that needs to be defined. You should read through your paper and see whether there are further instances of the error:



+ ?
: I can’t understand the meaning of the sentence or phrase.

+ Awk.
: Awkward. The phrase indicated may not be ungrammatical but it is poorly put.

+ Con
: You're being inconsistent here, i.e., you seem to be contradicting yourself.

+ Def
: Define what this word or phrase means.

+ Elab.
: Elaborate. This needs support. Why have you said this? Why or how is what you have written of use in your argument?

+ F.I.
: Follow instructions. You have not followed the instructions given on the assignment sheet.

+ Frag.
: Sentence Fragment. This is not a sentence. 

+ IAB
: intellectual autobiography (e.g. “The first time I heard this argument, it seemed really powerful….”); don’t give one.

+ Irr
: Irrelevant to the point of the paragraph or the essay.

+ Log.
: Logic is unclear or impossible. 

+ MQ
: The quotation is inaccurate.

+ MW
: Missing word

+ NG
: Not grammatical.

+ NNP
: No new paragraph. You've started a new paragraph where you shouldn't.

+ NSE
: Non-Standard English.

+ Par
: Break this into a new paragraph.

+ P.R.
: Proof read! By this point in your essay there have simply been too many mechanical errors to justify your receiving as high a grade as you could.

+ Quot
: Is this a quotation? Where are the quotation marks? (Avoid plagiarism!) It may also mean: Who said this?

+ Red
: Redundant. The phrase or word indicated is unnecessary, e.g., free gift.

+ Rel.
: How do you get from the idea in the former sentence (or phrase) to that of the latter? What is their relationship? The transition is unclear.

+ Rep.
: Repetition: you have already said this; move on

+ sl.
: Avoid slang.

+ SP.
: Correct the spelling/punctuation of this word.

+ TB
: Too brief. You are on track but you have left out steps or important details.

+ TG
: Too General. What you’ve said makes sense, but you need to explain more–facts need to be more specific, or supporting reasons need to be given.

+ w.w.
: This is the wrong word for the context; get a dictionary and look up the word you have used to find out why it is the wrong choice

+ WU
: Warm Up. What has been said doesn’t advance your answer. (Example: "Brock is a philosopher who writes about euthanasia.")

+ X
: Incorrect. Either facts or argument are in error. 

+ Xquot.
: Quotation error or error in paraphrase. Check the original.

+ WC
: You've used a word in an incorrect or awkward way. Consult a dictionary.


+ (not equals)
: Not equivalent. These two things are not the same.
