Grading Abbreviations

List of Common Comments and their Abbreviations

Below is a list of abbreviations that I use when grading papers or essay exams. Often, to draw your attention to a problem, I will underline or circle the sentence or part of a sentence that seems to be at the heart of the problem. To understand what the trouble is you should:

1.              look at what is circled or underlined

2.              look at the margins to see what my comment is

3.              check the original material or your notes to see if you understand the issue now

4.              talk to me about what remains unclear

Abbreviation

Comment and Explanation

 (checkmark)

Good point–on target! Keep this up!

?

I can’t understand the meaning of the sentence or phrase.

Awk.

This is an awkward construction.

Def

Define what this word or phrase means.

Elab.

Elaborate. This needs support. Why have you said this? Why or how is what you have written of use in your argument?

F.I.

Follow instructions. You have not followed the instructions given on the assignment sheet.

Frag.

Sentence Fragment. This is not a sentence. Essays must be written in complete sentences.

Irr

Irrelevant to the point of the paragraph or the essay.

Log.?

Logic is unclear or impossible. (E.g. "The man kissed the baby with a beard.")

NG

Not grammatical.

NSE

Non-Standard English: The English, she not written this way.

P.R.

Proof read! By this point in your essay there have simply been too many mechanical errors to justify your receiving as high a grade as you could.

Quot?

Is this a quotation? Where are the quotation marks? (Avoid plagiarism!) It may also mean: Who said this?

Rel.?

How do you get from the idea in the former sentence (or phrase) to that of the latter? What is their relationship? The transition is unclear.

Rep.

Repetition: you have already said this; move on

sl.

Avoid slang.

sp. or circle around word/punctuation

Correct the spelling/punctuation of this word.

TB

Too brief. You are on track but you have left out steps or important details.

TG

Too General. What you’ve said makes sense, but you need to explain more–facts need to be more specific, or supporting reasons need to be given.

w.w.

This is the wrong word for the context; get a dictionary and look up the word you have used to find out why it is the wrong choice

WU

Warm Up. What has been said doesn’t advance your answer. (Example: "Brock is a philosopher who writes about euthanasia.")

X

Incorrect. Either facts or argument are in error. Often followed by a specific reason.

Xquot.

Quotation error or error in paraphrase. Check the original.

 (not equals)

Not equivalent. These two things are not the same.
