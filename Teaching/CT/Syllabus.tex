\subsubsection{Course Information}\label{course-information}

\textbf{Title:} Critical Thinking

\textbf{Credits:} 3

\textbf{Prerequisites:} None

\textbf{Corequisites:} None

\subsubsection{Course Description}\label{course-description}

In this course, we will be learning how how to identify, analyze, and
evaluate arguments. We will begin by discussing what critical thinking
is and why we should improve our ability to do it. Since critical
thinking concerns arguments, the bulk of the course will focus on
reconstructing arguments and learning how to diagnose them. Topics to be
covered include argument patterns, argument types, fallacies,
introductory formal logic, probabilistic reasoning, and reasoning in the
law.

\subsubsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) identify the
difference between deductive and inductive arguments, (ii) assess the
former for validity and soundness, the latter for strength, (iii)
identify argument patterns, (iv) diagnoze their own thoughts, (v) reason
better.

\subsubsection{Texts/Media}\label{textsmedia}
