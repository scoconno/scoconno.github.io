\section{Copyright}
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Course Description}

In this course, we will be learning how how to identify, analyze, and
evaluate arguments. We will begin by discussing what critical thinking
is and why we should improve our ability to do it. Since critical
thinking concerns arguments, the bulk of the course will focus on
reconstructing arguments and learning how to diagnose them. Topics to be covered include argument patterns, argument types, fallacies,
introductory formal logic, probabilistic reasoning, and inference to the best explanation.


\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) identify the
difference between deductive and inductive arguments, (ii) assess the
former for validity and soundness, the latter for strength, (iii)
identify argument patterns, (iv) diagnose their own thoughts, (v) reason
better, (vi) manage their studies in a responsible and timely manner.
