``In claiming that objects inherit their spatial properties from the regions of space that they occupy, the substantivalist is inserting an invisible and redundant intermediary between objects. We cannot observe space itself, but we can observe objects at various distances from one another. The most economical way of making sense of this is simply to say that objects are directly related to one another by spatial relations. Instead of appealing to space-object relations, we can appeal to object-object relations, where the relations in question are of a spatial sort. These spatial relations should not be thought of as material objects in their own right, but as distinctive properties, of a relational sort, that material objects can possess.'' (Dainton, 141)

You might have them think about if from a 2 dimensional standpoint. You can make E become back to found E by turning it on its axis. But you cannot make a F become a back to front F in this way. (Maybe cut out the letter)



 




Here is some history on it.

Aristotle thinks the center of the universe coincides with center of the Earth. Up and down are relative to that. 


 but this is not always the case. For instance, it seems to make sense to ask whether the Earth rotates about its axis West- East diurnally or whether it is instead the heavens that rotate East-West; but if all motions are to be reckoned relative to the Earth, then its rotation seems impossible.


Descartes, Principles of Philosophy, 1644
