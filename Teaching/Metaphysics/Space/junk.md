These relations are two-place or dyadic relations; but obviously there can be three-place, four-place, and, generally, n-place relations.


## Ancient Debate

Democritus, Leuceppis, argue that two most fundamental principles are atoms and void (vaccuum). 


of body of any sort (including rarified substances such as air). Ancient atomism, dating back at least to the pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus (5th century, B. C.), held that not only is such possible, but in fact actually exists among the interstices of the smallest, indivisible parts of matter and extends without bound infinitely


ccording to Aristotle, the universe is a material plenum, finite in extent, bounded by the outermost sphere of the fixed stars. Beyond that there is no void, i.e., empty places, since, as Aristotle defines ‘place’, the place of something is the outermost of “the innermost motionless boundary of what contains it.” Hence, since there are no boundaries outside the outermost celestial sphere, there are no places or space outside of it.
Vacuum is an area devoid of any matter (object). Atoms move in the void. 

(dates) Physics, De Caelo

What's between you and the moon? Air? Might be gaps between air. 

Aristotle rejected the void and argued that everything is full. 

Motion for Aristotle. 

Absolute up, down, left, right

Center of Universe is the center of the Earth. So everything moves up and down



Aristotle remains supreme up until Galileo. 

+ Vacua exist
+ Earth is not stationary. 




## Motion 

The second is about absolute motion. Think of being still. Are you? Well Earth is moving. So not really. We might say that you are still relative to the person beside you. But not still relative to the sun. Compare this to being on a train. One issue is whether there is absolute motion. What would the relationalist say? 

The original debate between relationist and absolutist views oi space arose from the Newtonian theory of motion. Newton had dis- tinguished between two kinds of motion: relative and absolute. Relative motion is the change in spatial relations between objects. Imagine two people in conversation as they descend into the depths of the London Underground. One descends by means of the stairs, the other on the escalator. Relative to the walls around them, they are moving at the same rate. As a consequence (since they are mov- ing in the same direction), both are stationary relative to each other, and so can continue their conversation. But now the one descending the stairs stops to tie his shoelaces. His companion, to be polite, now starts to ascend the downwards-moving escalator, so that she remains stationary relative to her friend, and as a result is moving with considerable speed relative to the escalator steps. Now, in addi- tion to these relative motions, there is, or so we are powerfully inclined to suppose, what we might call real motion. If A is in motion relative to B, then B is correspondingly in motion relative to A. But is it A or B that is really moving, the other remaining stationary? Or are they both moving? 

Absolute motion is the name given to motion relative to space itself. If there are such things as points in space, independently of any other object, then these points are by definition stationary (since to be stationary is to stay in the same place and a point is a place). Anything which moves relative to these points is in motion.

## Absolutism 

Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727)



“Space is eternal in duration and immutable in nature... Although space may be empty of body, nevertheless it is itself not a void: and something is there, because spaces are there, although nothing more than that.” (De Gravitatione, as quoted by Dainton, 133)

“Absolute space, in its own nature, without relation to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.” (Principia, as quoted by Huggett, 118)

primitive relation of ‘spatiallocatedness’ holds between objects and places in spaceAccording to Newton, the physical furniture of the universe consists entirely of infinitesimal material points, commonly referred to as particles. Extended objects, or objects that take up finite volumes of space, are treated as assemblages of particles, and the behaviours of objects are determined, at least in principle, by the behaviours of the particles of which they are composed. The properties of particles include mass, electric charge, and position.
he Newtonian conception is both complete and deterministic. It is complete in the sense that, if it were possible to list, for each moment of past time, what particles existed, what their masses, electric charges, and other intrinsic properties were, and what positions they occupied, the list would represent absolutely everything that could be said about the physical history of the universe; it would contain everything that existed and every event that occurred. The Newtonian conception is deterministic in the sense that, if it were possible to list, for a particular moment of time, the position and other intrinsic properties of each particle in the universe, as well as how the position of each particle is changing as time flows forward, the entire future history of the universe, in every detail, would be predictable with absolute certainty.
The rate at which the position of a particle is changing at a particular time, as time flows forward, is called the velocity of the particle at that time. The rate at which the velocity of a particle is changing at a particular time, as time flows forward, is called the acceleration of the particle at that time. The Newtonian conception stipulates that force, which acts to maintain or alter the motion of a particle, arises exclusively between pairs of particles; furthermore, the forces that any two particles exert on each other at any given moment depend only on what sorts of particles they are and on their positions relative to each other. Thus, within Newtonian mechanics (the science of the motion of bodies under the action of forces), the specification of the positions of all the particles in the universe at a particular time and of what sorts of particles they are amounts to a specification of what forces are operating on each of those particles at that time.
According to Newton’s second law of motion, a certain very simple mathematical relation invariably holds between the total force on any particle at a particular time, its acceleration at that time, and its mass; the force acting on a particle is equal to the particle’s mass multiplied by its acceleration:
F = ma

The application of this law (hereafter “Newton’s law of motion”) can be illustrated in detail in the following example. Suppose that one wished to calculate, for each particle i in a certain subsystem of the universe, the position of that particle at some future time t = T. For each particle at some initial time t = 0, one is given the particle’s position (x0i), velocity (v0i), mass (mi), electric charge (ci), and all other intrinsic properties.

One way of performing the calculation is by means of a succession of progressively better approximations. Thus, the first approximation might be to calculate the positions of all the particles at t = T by supposing that their velocities are constant and equal to v0i at t = 0 throughout the interval between t = 0 and t = T. This approximation would place particle i at x0i + v0i(T) at t = T. It is apparent, however, that the approximation would not be very accurate, because in fact the velocities of the particles would not remain constant throughout the interval (unless no forces were at work on them).

A somewhat better approximation could be obtained by dividing the time interval in question into two, one interval extending from t = 0 to t = T/2 and the other extending from t = T/2 to t = T. Then the positions of all the particles at T/2 could be calculated by supposing that their velocities are constant and equal to their values at t = 0 throughout the interval between t = 0 and t = T/2; this would place particle i at x0i + v0i(T/2) at T/2. The forces acting on each of the particles at t = 0 could then be calculated, according to the Newtonian conception, from their positions at t = 0 together with their masses, charges, and other intrinsic properties, all of which were given at the outset.

The velocities of the particles at T/2 could be obtained by plugging the values of these forces into Newton’s law of motion, F = ma, and assuming that, throughout the interval from t = 0 to t = T/2, their accelerations are constant and equal to their values at t = 0. This would make the velocity of particle i equal to v0 + a0i(T/2), where a0i is equal to the force on particle i at t = 0 divided by particle i’s mass. Finally, the position of particle i at t = T could be calculated by supposing that i maintains the new velocity throughout the interval between t = T/2 and t = T.

Although this approximation would also be inaccurate, it is an improvement over the first one because the intervals during which the velocities of the particles are erroneously presumed to be constant are shorter in the second calculation than in the first. Of course, this improvement can itself be improved upon by dividing the interval further, into 4 or 8 or 16 intervals.

As the number of intervals approaches infinity, the calculation of the particles’ positions at t = T approaches perfection. Thus, given a simple-enough specification of the dependence of the forces to which the particles are subjected on their relative positions, the techniques of integral calculus can be used to carry out the perfect calculation of the particles’ positions. Because T can have any positive value whatsoever, the positions of all the particles in the system in question at any time between t = 0 and t = ∞ (infinity) can in principle be calculated, exactly and with certainty, from their positions, velocities, and intrinsic properties at t = 0.

Newtonian mechanics predicts the motions of particles, or how the positions of particles in space change with time. But the very possibility of there being a theory that predicts how the positions of particles in space change with time requires that there be a determinate matter of fact about what position each particle in space happens to occupy. In other words, such a theory requires that space itself be an independently existing thing—the sort of thing a particle might occupy a certain part of, or the sort of thing relative to which a particle might move.The first theory is generally called absolutism about space (although it also goes by the name of substantivalism), and holds that space exists independently of objects: that is, the existence of space does not require there to be anything else in the world. Space contains objects, rather like a box, only in this case we suppose the box to have no sides. Space is, for the absolutist, an additional object in the world, something by virtue of which objects have spatial positions and stand in spatial relations to each other.

Absolute space is  also called substantivalism. 

Allows for void and absolute motion. 

Newton, Kant, 

Space and time exist as independent substances, i.e. they are existing particulars in their own right, over and above the material content of the universe. Space and time are continuous and pervasive media that extend everywhere and everywhere.


## Relationalism 


The doubt is based on the fact that it is difficult even to imagine how a measurement of the absolute position in space of any particle, or any assemblage of particles, could be carried out. What observation, for example, would determine whether every single particle in the universe suddenly had moved to a position exactly one million kilometres to the left of where it was before? 

Therefore, something can be a fact about space only if it is relational—a fact about the distances between particles. Talk of facts about “absolute” positions is simply nonsense.

Relationism, as this view of the nature of space is called, asserts that space is not an independently existing thing but merely a mathematical representation of the infinity of different spatial relations that particles may have to each other. In the opposing view, known as absolutism, space is an independently existing thing, and what facts about the universe there may be do not necessarily coincide with what can in principle be established by measurement.

ewtonian mechanics makes claims about how the positions of particles—and not merely their relative positions—change with time, and it makes claims about what laws would govern the motion of a particle entirely alone in the universe. Relationism, on the other hand, is committed to the proposition that it is nonsensical even to inquire what these laws might be.


Leibniz-Clarke correspondence (1715-16)
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716)

“In claiming that objects inherit their spatial properties from the regions of space that they occupy, the substantivalist is inserting an invisible and redundant intermediary between objects. We cannot observe space itself, but we can observe objects at various distances from one another. The most economical way of making sense of this is simply to say that objects are directly related to one another by spatial relations. Instead of appealing to space-object relations, we can appeal to object-object relations, where the relations in question are of a spatial sort. These spatial relations should not be thought of as material objects in their own right, but as distinctive properties, of a relational sort, that material objects can possess.” (Dainton, 141)

Space and time do not exist as independent substances, there is only the material content of the universe. Space and time are merely defined through spatiotemporal relations among the material objects in the universe.


relationalism not cost-free: there must be spatial relationsover and above the material objects that exist
relationalism is committed to non-existence of unoccupied places and regions, whereas substantivalist account entails possibility of empty places
The rival theory, relationism about space, rejects the notion of space as a container, and the implication that space is an object in its ownLeibniz, who provided a number of arguments against absolutism, draws a useful analogy which likens space as the relationist sees it to a fam- ily, or genealogical tree:[T]he Mind can fancy to itself an Order made up of Genealogical Lines, whose Bigness would consist only in the Number of Generations, wherein every Person would have his Place. (Alexander 1956, 70)A family is simply a group of people standing in certain relations to each other: daughter, uncle, cousin, etc. The relations are something additional to the collection of individual people, but can we there- fore talk of the family as an object in its own right, containing differ- ent people at different times? Leibniz develops the analogy further:and if to this one should add the Fiction of a Metempsychosis, and bring in the same Human Souls again; the Persons in those Lines might change place; he who was a Father, or a Grandfather, might become a Son, or a Grand-son etc. (Ibid. 70-1)Even without this particular fiction, we do talk in abstract terms of the family, as when we say, for example 'the nuclear family is under threat', or 'the Sixties changed the way we look at the family.' But we are using 'the family' here as a general expression, not as a means of referring to some particular item in the world. In similar terms, we talk of 'the Papacy', or 'the Presidency of the United States', not because there is some concrete item which persists through changes of holders of the office, but because different people at different times come to stand in the same relations to other people or institu- tions. As Leibniz goes on to say of his family analogy:
And yet those Genealogical Places, Lines, and Spaces, though they should express real Truths, would only be Ideal Things. (Ibid. 71)Thus the family, as a concrete object, exists only if the constituent people do. Likewise, space exists only if its contents do.
volumes of space that are not occupied by any object. Indeed, it would be in trouble if it did not allow these. But those empty places are, literally, nothing at all. There is a gap between two objects, say this chair and that window, not because there is some third entity between them, but because they are 5 yards apart and nothing is closer to either of them along the straight line from one to the other. Remove the objects and you are left with nothing.The absolutist will reply that these distance relations only obtain between objects because of the existence of actual, unoccupied spaces. Again, drawing on the family analogy, but this time to illus- trate the absolutist position, Tom is only Lucy's uncle by virtue of the fact that Lucy's mother is Tom's sister. Tom and Lucy do not stand in the family relation they do directly, but only by virtue of the relations they stand in to some third entity (Tom's sister). Their rela- tion is, as one might put it, mediated. Likewise, for the absolutist, spatial relations are mediated. The relationist will object that these intervening spaces have no role to play. Why, they will say, should distance relations not be direct and unmediated? Here the absolutist tnight point to a number of roles these unoccupied points could play. First, they could playa role as objects of reference. 'Put the flowers over there: I say, indicating an empty space in the corner of the room. What does the 'there' refer to? Something, presumably, but not to any perceptible object. I cannot be referring, for example, to an area of the carpet. I do not want the flowers to be put in the area presently occupied by that part of the carpet, requiring the flower- bearer to start digging a hole in the floor.
