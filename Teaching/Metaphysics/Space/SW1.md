## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the assigned readings and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submissions as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

## Format
Please submit the file as either a word or rich text file. A pdf is fine too.

## Prompt 

The existence of a higher spatial dimensions has been taken to be important for assessing Kant's argument for Absolute Space. Assume that such dimensions exist. This essay has two parts. 

1. Explain Internalism with respect to Incongruent Counterparts.  
2. Explain how the existence of higher dimensions poses a threat to Internalism.
 

## Further Instruction

+ This essay has 2 major learning goals. The first is to teach the difference between explaining a view and arguing for a view. In the first part of your paper, you should neutrally explain Internalism as clearly as you can, but avoid giving any arguments for or against Internalism. In the second part of your essay, you will be arguing against Internalism by using the possibility of higher spatial dimensions. The second learning goal is to teach you to separate your own views from the explanations and arguments you might provide. Un the first part of your essay, you should explain Internalism as clearly and charitably as you can (as if it was the view you accepted). In the second part, you will use possibility of higher dimensions to argue against Internalism as forcibly as you can (regardless of whether you think there are higher dimensions or if you think that Internalism is true or not.) 

+ Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. You will need to explain the terminology you introduce. Try also to find ways of explaining what a fourth dimension might be.
