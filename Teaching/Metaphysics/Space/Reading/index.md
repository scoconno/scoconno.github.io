# 'Flatland'

In addition to the readings from the text book, we will also be reading the short novel 'Flatland' by Edwin A. Abbott for this module. I provide links to the reading in various formats below. This is a primer for the philosophical readings to come, so I encourage you to skim through it, enjoy it as a novel. I also want to alert you to the author's poor portrayal of women. He was criticised for it, and rightly so, even when the novel was published in 1884. Don't let it distract you from the interesting questions it raises: what would a 2-dimensional universe be like? Could we imagine a 4-dimensional universe? 

## Important Sections

The sections are short. The most important: 1,3,5,6,13--20.
