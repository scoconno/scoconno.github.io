Vonnegut’s pure fatalism is buttressed by the classic portrayal of four-dimensional space-time that Billy Pilgrim learns from the Trafalmadorians.  The Trafalmadorians do not experience time in a linear fashion, but all at once.  This fatalism, then, is also a form of consolation, since any awful condition of a person co-exists with their happiness or peace at many other times, all of which exist (in the sense of being actually present events, not merely possible or remembered events) unchangingly.

“When a Trafalmadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in many other moments.” (p.27)

This leads to one of the greatest descriptions of four-dimensionalism ever:

Tralfamadorians … can see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.  And Trafalmadorians don’t see human beings as two-legged creatures, either. They see them as great millipedes – “with babies’ legs at one end and old people’s legs at the other,” says Billy Pilgrim. (p. 87)
