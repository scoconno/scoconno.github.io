## The Arrows of Time ##

Could time run backwards? 
Is there not some hidden constraint, some underlying directedness, within time itself, that makes processes within time go one way rather than another? 


Clearly, we are, within certain limits, free to go where we want to in space: we can go backwards, forwards, up and down, sideways in either direction.


Consider, then, the relation <earlier than'. This relation orders things in time, and does so, we might suppose, in a way that reflects the direction of time.


we can order things in space. 

Left of, right of, etc. These are relations that are transitive and non-reflexive and it looks like asymmetrical. It is from a fixed reference point, from perspective z, x is left to a, blah

Left of needs a reference point. But temporal relations don't need a reference point. 

Not quite there yet. 

Consider order of numbers

5, 10, 15, 20, etc. Could be read one way or the other. 

Time ain't like that. It must go in one direction only, i.e., the relationship of events have blah. 

What determines the order of time?  

1.  the thermodynamic arrow: the direction from order to disorder; 
2.   the psychological arrow: the direction from perceptions of events to the memories of those events;3  the causal arrow: the direction from cause to effect.
## Thermodynamic order ##
According to a familiar and informal statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, heat tends to move from a hotter body to a cooler one, thus warming it up. This means that there is a tendency for heat to become ever more widely and evenly distributed. What has this got to do with order? Well, consider a cup of freshly poured tea steaming away on the table. This is a relatively ordered situation, because the energy present in it is concentrated in a relatively small area. There is ener- gy in the form of heat in the small area occupied by the tea. There is also energy in the forces holding the cup together. 
The cup descends, dashing itself to pieces on the floor, and spilling the tea around the room. The potential energy of the cup was transformed into kinetic energy as it fell, and then into sound and heat as it smashed on the floor. The heat from the tea is now rapidly dispersing itself into the air. 
n these cases, energy is becoming more widely dispersed, and this is what is meant, in this context, by increasing disorder, and it is referred to as an increase in entropy.
Where any change occurs in an isolated system, entropy either stays con- stant orincreases.
The thermodynamic analysis of time order: event A is earlier than event B if and only if the universe is, when B occurs, in a higher state of entropy than it is when A occurs.## Psychological arrow ##
The psychological analysis of time order: A is earlier than B if and only if A is the content of a memory at the same time that B is the content of a perception.
