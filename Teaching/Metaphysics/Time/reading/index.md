# Slaughterhouse Five

I attach here a link to Kurt Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse Five.* We're interested in the two understandings of time we encounter in the novel, one by the Tralfamadorians, the other by humans. Ignore ch.1. The story begins with ch.2. Read at least ch.2,3,4 & 5, paying special attention to ch.5. You will need an ePub reader to open the file, iBooks or something similar.
