## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the assigned readings and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submissions as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

## Format
Please submit the file as either a word or rich text file. A pdf is fine too.

## Grading

## Word Count

Your submission must be 600-800 words long. Essays shorter than 600 words or longer than 800 words will lose points. 

## Prompt 

Some have tried to define the direction of time in terms of 
our psychology, i.e., in terms of the 'Psychological Arrow'. First try explain the direction of time with the psychological arrow, then raise one objection to this view. 

 

## Further Instruction

+ This essay covers material from ch.12 of Robin Le Poidevin's 'Travel in Four Dimensions', especially p.213--218. Find the link on the website in module 3. 

+ Make sure to introduce the problem that the Psychological Arrow supposedly solves before explaining how it solves it. 

+ We did not discuss the Psychological Arrow in class. This was by design. Read the text carefully. Take notes.   

+ Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. You will need to explain the terminology you introduce.
