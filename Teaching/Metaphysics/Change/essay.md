title: Research Essay 1 
---

### Prompt 

How might David Lewis use the existence of temporal parts to solve the paradox of increase (also called the debtor's paradox)? What is the biggest difficulty for this proposed solution? Can the difficulty be overcome? Give reasons for your answer. 

### Further Instruction 

This essay covers material from Michael Rea's 'Problem of Change' (on my website) plus the following two readings from the reader:  

1.  Quine, ‘Identity, Ostension, and Hypostasis'
2.  Lewis, `In Defense of Stages: Postscript B to “Survival and
    Identity”'

I have not supplied you with readings that deny the existence of temporal parts. This is by design. For this essay, you must identify, read, and use one scholarly article that presents an objection to Lewis. Note that a scholarly article is not equivalent to an encyclopedia entry, though you are welcome to use the encyclopedias listed on my website to identify a scholarly article. A scholarly article is one that is published in a peer reviewed journal like *Mind*, *The Philosophical Review*, *Nous*, *Philosophical Studies*, etc. You should begin your search by using [http://philpapers.org](http://philpapers.org). After that, you will need to visit the library, or, at least, spend time using the online library research tools. 

### Word Count

1250--1500 words. Writing less than 12500 or more than 1500 words will lose you points. 


### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submissions as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

### Due Date

### Late Submissions
