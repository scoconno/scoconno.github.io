### Motion does not exist 

1.  Space is infinitely divisible or not infinitely divisible.

2.  If space is infinitely divisible, motion is impossible.

3.  If space is not infinitely divisible, motion is impossible.

4.  Motion is impossible (From 1-3).


### Premise 1 - the divisibility of space 


-   If x is infinitely divisible, x can be divided into ever smaller
    parts *ad infinitum*. In other words, x contains no indivisible
    parts, i.e. parts that cannot further be divided.

    -   For example, suppose that a line, L, is infinitely divisible.
        Lines are divided into line segments. So every line segment of L
        can be divided into further smaller line segments - there is no
        smallest line segment.

    -   Think of this process of dividing something out as
        merely conceptual. Don’t worry whether or not we could literally
        do something to x to divide it in this way.

-   If x is not infinitely divisible, x can be divided into a finite
    number of *smallest* parts, i.e. parts that cannot be divided into
    any smaller parts.

    -   For example, suppose that a line, L, is not
        infinitely divisible. Then L contains a finite number of
        smallest line segments, i.e., line segments with some smallest
        extent that cannot be divided into any further line segments.

### Premise 3
This handout will proceed by discussing Premise 3. See Handout 1 for discussion of Premise 2. Zeno offers two distinct arguments for Premise 3 that again come in the form of paradoxes.  The strategy for each is similar. We will fist assume that space is not infinitely divisible, then prove that certain absurdities follow. If an assumption leads to an absurdity, we know the assumption is false. 

### The Stadium Paradox

> The fourth argument is that concerning equal bodies which move alongside equal bodies in the stadium from opposite directions—the ones from the end of the stadium, the others from the middle—at equal speeds, in which he thinks it follows that half the time is equal to its double…. (Aristotle Physics, 239b33)

Suppose these rows of blocks represent some chariots in a stadium. The B's are stationary. The A's are moving from left to right. The last block in that row is called D. The Cs are moving towards from right to left. The middle block in that row is called E. The Suppose also that the As and Cs are traveling at the same speed. 



|  |    T1      |  |
|----------|-------------|------|
| 	|DAA| --> |
|  |BBB   |    |
| <--  |CEC|   |	 



|  |    T3      |  |
|----------:|-------------|:------|
| --> 	|&nbsp; DA|A|
|  |BBB|    |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; C|EC&nbsp;| <--  |	


Compare Times 1 and 3. Suppose they are separated by a one minute interval. In this interval, D has passed one B block and two C blocks. Zeno thinks this is paradoxical. It's unclear why. For our purposes, let us assume the following: 

1. There is smallest possible length, *S*
2. The length of each block is S. 
3. There are no gaps between the blocks.
4. The blocks move with constant velocity. 


It took 1 minute for D to pass two C blocks. It should take 30 second to pass one C block. Suppose D passes one C block after 30 seconds. How many B blocks has it passed? Try filling out the diagram below to answer that question. 


|  |    T3      |  |
|----------:|-------------|:------|
| --> 	|DAA||
|  | ? |    |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; C|EC&nbsp;| <--  |

This describes the time that D and E are level. 

We are stuck! Suppose that someone claims that D has passed *half of one B block.* Let this half be called *H*. What is H's length? You cannot, on pain of contradiction, claim that H has a length less than S. We have assumed that S is the smallest possible length, so H cannot be shorter than S. 

This way of stating the paradox assumes that the length of time between T1 and T2 can be divided in two, i.e., 1 minute is divided into two 30 second intervals. Suppose that time is also atomic, that there is a smallest interval of time, a single quantum of time. Suppose also that the motion between T1 and T2 takes a single quantum of time. If this is correct, there is no T2 (which was half the interval between T1 and T2. )Paradox still threatens. During a single quantum of time, D and E will have passed each other (as is seen in T2), but there is no moment at which they are level as is described in T3: since the two moments are separated by the smallest possible time, there can be no instant between them—it would be a time smaller than the smallest time from the two moments we considered. Conversely, if one insisted that if they pass then there must be a moment when they are level, then it shows that cannot be a shortest finite interval—whatever it is, just run this argument against it. 



### The Arrow Paradox

> The third is … that the flying arrow is at rest, which result follows from the assumption that time is composed of moments … . he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always in a now, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. (Aristotle Physics, 239b.30)

> Zeno abolishes motion, saying “What is in motion moves neither in the place it is nor in one in which it is not”. (Diogenes Laertius Lives of Famous Philosophers, ix.72)

 
1. Suppose that space is not infinitely divisible. 
2. If space is not infinitely divisible, then there is a finite number of smallest regions of spaces between two points, A and B.
3. There is a finite number of smallest regions of space between A and B.
4. If an arrow moves from A to B from t1 to tn, at some time between t1 to tn, it must occupy each region of space between A and B. 
5. If an arrow occupies a region of space at a time, then it is at rest in that moment in that region. 
6. An arrow at rest in different regions of space at different times, does not move. 
7. The arrow does not move.   


This argument is valid and straightforward. It relies on the intuitive notion that a whole, w, cannot have a property P, when it's parts have some contradictory property, Q. If each part of the table is blue, the whole table cannot be red. Similarly, if the parts of the arrows flight are parts where the arrow is at rest, then the whole flight cannot be a motion. 

, but some deny that it is not sound because C1 is false. They claim that it relies on the false assumption that completing an infinite series of tasks would take an infinite period of time. This seems false. As we divide the distances between the points we travel, we should also divide the time it takes to travel the ever smaller distances: 


### Response 

While the argument is valid, many will deny the claim that the arrow is at rest at each moment. Again, this is about calculus.[^1] 



### Objection

On this response, motion at a time t1, depends on what is happening before and after t1. A main concern is that what's happening in this moment cannot be dependent on what's happening in the future. The future does not yet exist. 

Let us imagine that an arrow is moving. Let us assume that God exists. Let us assume that God will annihilate all things and time immediately after t1. Well, it looks like the arrow was not moving at t1.
