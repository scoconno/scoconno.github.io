\section{Catalog Description}

What do you know? Do you know anything? What exists? Are there objective truths about whatâ€™s right and wrong for you to do, or is it all a matter of convention? Does being a moral person go against your self-interest? If so, why should you be a moral person? What is happiness? Will being a moral person contribute to your happiness? These questions were raised by philosophers speaking and writing in Greek over two millennia ago. In this course, we will think hard about these questions and try to identify how they were answered by three of the most influential philosophers of all time---Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Hellenestics. 

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course students will be able to (i) read
philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv)
write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and
persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of the
philosophies of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Hellenistics.
