\section*{Epicurus' main argument}

\noindent Principal Doctrine II: ``Death is nothing to us. For what has been dissolved has no sense-experience, and what has no sense-experience is nothing to us.''
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Expanded argument:
\vspace*{2mm}

[P1] Good and bad consist in sense-experience
\vspace*{1mm}

[P2] Death is the privation of sense-experience
\vspace*{1mm}

[P3] Hence death---i.e. \emph{being dead}---is not good or bad
\vspace*{1mm}

[P4] So, if you are dead, it is not good or bad for you
\vspace*{1mm}

\underline{[P5] It is irrational to fear the future occurrence of something which is not bad when it is present}
\vspace*{1mm}

[C] Hence it is irrational to fear death
\vspace{2mm}

\noindent [P1] relies on E's hedonism
\vspace*{1mm}

E claims that ``Pleasure is the starting point and goal of living blessedly'' (\emph{LM} 128)
\vspace*{1mm}

E's hedonism, however, is not what you might think: ``The removal of all feeling of pain is the limit of the\\\hspace*{6mm}magnitude of pleasures. Wherever a pleasurable feeling is present, for as long as it is present, there is\\\hspace*{6mm}neither a feeling of pain nor a feeling of distress, nor both together'' (\emph{PD} III)
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent [P2] relies on E's doctrine of the soul
\vspace*{1mm}

E is an atomist: all reality consists in atoms (i.e. indivisible, indestructible, units of matter) and void
\vspace*{1mm}

Even the soul, according to E, is composed of atoms (i.e. the soul is a body---quite different from Plato\\\hspace*{6mm}and Aristotle), which ``dissipate'' upon death
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent If [P1] and [P2] are too controversial, maybe we can substitute less controversial variants:
\vspace*{2mm}

[P1*] Good and bad depend on there being a subject who could experience them
\vspace*{1mm}

[P2*] Death is the extinction of the `self' or `person' --- i.e. of the subject capable of experience
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent A lot seems to depend on P1* (the rest might seem undeniable), is it true?
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Three central problems Epicurus has highlighted:
\vspace*{2mm}

[A] How can something be bad for \emph{S} if \emph{S} does not or \emph{cannot} mind or care one way or the other, since \emph{S} is\\\hspace*{13mm}non-existent?
\vspace*{1mm}

[B] Who could be the possessor or subject of this bad once \emph{S} is non-existent?
\vspace*{1mm}

[C] When could the subject suffer this bad?
\newpage

\section*{Responses}

\noindent \textbf{Nagel}
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent [1] Death is bad because it involves the deprivation of goods---e.g. perception, thought, emotion
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [2] Goods and bads for someone do not depend on that person's awareness of them (cf. \emph{EN} 1.10)
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent E.g.: Suppose we all have significant others who, while we are here, get together for swinging affairs; suppose that part of our well-being stems from the (perhaps unconscious) faith in our SO's fidelity; suppose further that none of us ever find out about it and that, if anything, the only consequences we experience are in a sense beneficial (e.g. our SO's are nicer, kinder, etc. to us as a result); it still seems like this is bad \emph{for us}
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent [3] The person who is deprived of goods by death is a ``possible person''---i.e. the person who was alive, but so understood as to include the (unrealised) possibilities of her continued life
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent E.g.: An accident victim suffers head-injuries. Her IQ drops to 20, but she is ``happy'' or, at least, ``cheerful.'' We tend to think that the ``person'' is unfortunate; but the current person is quite ``happy.'' So we must be ascribing the misfortune to the person-she-could-have-been = a ``possible person''
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent So, Nagel rejects both [P1] and [P1*]
\vspace*{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Furley}
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent [1] Death is bad because it involves the frustration of our previous plans, hopes and desires
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [2] The frustration of our current plans etc. would make our present actions pointless
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [3] Hence it is rational to fear death, since it is rational to fear that our current actions are pointless
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent E.g.: a terminally-ill person is deceived about her condition; her concern with her plans for a holiday next spring is pointless---and she would think so too if she knew about her condition
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Furley rejects [P5]
\vspace*{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Epicurus' response to Furley}
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent \emph{PD}III
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [1] Happiness requires only the satisfaction of our natural and necessary desires
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [2] These desires can be satisfied by a self-sufficient life---i.e. one which does not involve long-term projects
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [3] So you don't understand what happiness is if you think that it involves long-term projects, etc.
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent [4] Hence your fear of death is ``empty''---i.e. rests on a false belief---and thus irrational
