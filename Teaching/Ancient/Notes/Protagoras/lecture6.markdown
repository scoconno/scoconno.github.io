# Plato's Protagoras #


#### Questions 



- First question might just be about akrasia. Can you knowingly do something wrong? If you know that doing F is good, can you fail to do so? Could get them to talk about food. 
- To set this up, I'll need to set up the distinction between knowledge and mere belief. Or do I? Is akrasia an issue between believing F is wrong and doing it anyway? Or is it between knowledge and action? 
- I could talk about serial killers, maybe that movie about vietnam war. Anything from a movie? I think it should be focused on other people---any legal issue I can bring up? 
- Second question might focus on teaching morality. 



#### 317e-334c ####



Protagoras (a well-known sophist) claims to teach his students “sound
deliberation” (*euboulia*), which Socrates equates with the “art of
citizenship” (*politikê technê*) and “virtue” (*aretê*)

S wonders whether virtue can be taught (P’s claim presupposes that it
can)

S asks P, “Is virtue a single thing, with justice and temperance and
piety its parts, or are the things I have just listed all names for a
single entity” (329d) Two options for “parts”:

1. In the sense in which the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears are
    parts of the face (heterogenous parts)</span>

-    In the sense in which there are “parts” of a block of gold
    (homogenous parts)</span>

S asks further whether someone can have some parts of virtue *without*
having all of them

-   <span>P says yes, and points to (allegedly) courageous but unjust
    people, just but unwise people, ...</span>

S argues that the virtues do form a unity, each of them being some kind
of knowledge/understanding (*epistêmê*)

-   <span>P (begrudgingly) agrees that all the virtues *except* courage may be kinds of knowledge    


#### Hedonism ####


Pleasant things are good insofar as they are pleasant (pleasure is *a*
good)

Pleasant things alone are good (pleasure is *the* good)

-   <span>[B1]: One’s present pleasure is the good</span>

-   <span>[B2]: Maximized pleasure is the good (S attributes this view
    to the many, 354a-c)</span>

S also assumes that all pleasures and pains are “commensurable”—all
pleasures and pains can be weighed against each other; thus, in
principle, all pleasures and pains can be ranked

#### The experience of “*akrasia*,” (“being overcome,” “lack of self-control,” “weakness of will”), as reported by “the many” (*hoi polloi*) 


One’s knowledge (*epistêmê*) that an action is bad can be overcome by desire, pleasure, pain, love, fear, etc. (352b, d, 353c)

Two explicit versions:

1. X does B, i) knowing B is bad, ii) when able not to do B,
    and iii) overwhelmed by pleasure</span>

2. X does not do G, i) knowing G is good, ii) when able to do
    G, and iii) overwhelmed by pleasure</span>

#### Socrates’ aim ####

The probandum (“thing to be proved”): Knowledge “rules” in a person—if X
knows that A is good, X will do A, if X can; if X knows that A is bad, X
will *not* do X, if X can

-   <span>If S proves this, he will have shown that the akratic
    situation is impossible or misdescribed</span>

-   <span>Given that S suspects virtue is some kind of knowledge, it is
    clear why he wants to argue for this</span>


#### Socrates’ argument ####


- [P1]Pleasure is the good

- [P2]All pleasures and pains are commensurable

- [P3] The akratic situation, when re-described in accordance with [P1], amounts to:

	- 1* X did B, knowing B to be bad and able not to do it,
    because X was overcome by good =</span>

	-   <span>X did something painful, knowing it to be painful and able not to do it, because X was overcome by pleasure</span>

- [P4] In 1* the good/pleasure is less than the overall bad/pain X chose to get

- [P5] So in both cases, X chose to do what X knew was worse/more painful instead of what was less bad or less painful

- [C] Therefore, it is only ignorance of the relative weights of the
alternatives that can explain X’s selection of the worse

S re-describes the akratic situation as being a manifestation of
“ignorance” (*amathia*)—the “power of appearance” leads a person to
miscalculate the relative weight of an immediate pleasure (e.g. just as
seeing something in a distance can lead us to judge (mistakenly) that it
is smaller than something that is up close)

S uses this conclusion to argue that even courage is a kind of
knowledge/understanding, namely knowledge of “what is and is not to be
feared” (360d8-9)

#### Problems ####

- Is hedonism plausible in its own right?

- P6 is only plausible if all desire is for the maximized good or that there is only one kind of desire/faculty of desire. Are there desires that are not aimed at the good?

- Does S illegitimately move between Hedonism B1 and B2 in his argument?

- Even if S’s argument succeeds, is there an epistemic problem? If virtue is to guarantee correct action, and virtue is a kind of
knowledge/understanding, will this require unrealistic demands of
knowing *all* the future consequences of our actions?
