# Aristotle Overview

+ Born in Stagira in Macedonia around 384 BCE
+ Macedonia is far North of Greece
+ Father was a physician at the Macedonian court. 
+ Moved to Athens at the age of 17 to study at Plato’s Academy in 367 BCE
	+ 470/69 BCE: Socrates is born in Athens
	+ 428/27 BCE: Plato is born, studies with Socrates
	+ 399 BCE: Socrates is executed for impiety and corrupting the
    youth of Athens
	+ 387 BCE: Plato establishes the Academy
+ Athens was the cultural, political, and financial capital of the Mediterranean. 

In the fifth and fourth centuries, during the lifetimes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, Athens was an independent state consisting of the urban area and the surrounding rural areas of Attica. (The total population is difficult to estimate. It may have had about 20,000 citizens; see below on the definition of ‘citizen’.) Other Greek cities were allies of or subordinate to Athens; the Athenian alliance was opposed to a roughly similar alliance of other Greek cities led by Sparta.

Aristotle was not a citizen of Athens, and his relationship with the Athenians wasn't an easy one. Athens (like some other Greek cities, but by no means all) had a democratic constitution. The Greek ‘dêmokratia’ is derived from ‘kratos’ (power) and ‘dêmos’ (used both for ‘the people’ as a whole, and in a more specific sense for the lower classes); hence it indicates that power belonged to the people as a whole, rather than to a particular class. Greek democracy was significantly different from the representative system that we are used to calling ‘democracy’.  (The Greeks would have regarded the present US constitution as a form of ‘oligarchy’ – literally ‘rule by the few’.)  It involved ‘direct’ democracy, in so far as the most important decisions were taken by a mass meeting of all citizens.

Aristotle Was known as the “brain of the academy”. None of his writings from that time survive. Nevertheless, when in 347 BCE, Plato dies and Philip of Macedonia overthrows Athenian allies, Aristotle is not made head of the academy. He flees with other academics to Assos on the North Aegean Coast of Turkey. The Persian war forces him to retreat to the island of lesbos. There he marries Pythias, the adoptive daugther of King Hermias. He begins his life long love of biology. One third of his writing is about Biology; Pythias was accomplished in her own right.  

Phillip II invites Aristotle back to Macedonia to tutor his son, Alexander. Alexander became the Alexander the Great. He conquered North Africa, middle East, Iran, really all of  west Asia, and all the way to North India. He was attempting to conquer the entire world, and he was surprised by his failure. But his failure is deeply important for understanding the spread of Greek culture in general and Aristotelian philosophy in particular. There are two reasons for this. First, he spread Greek culture far beyond Athen, most importantly he spread the teachings of his beloved Aristotle. Second, he made available to Aristotle the largest empire ever known to assist Aristotle in his work. Aristotle, for instance, intended to learn about every bird, plant, fish, mammal, etc., and Alexander made available tens of thousands of soldiers, farmers, etc., to compile reports, send samples, etc. 

In 334 BCE, Aristotle returns to Athens under the protection of Amtipater who had been appointed by Alexander to rule Athens. Aristotle has a daughter at this time named Pythia after his wife, but his wife dies. He marries another woman Herpyllis and has a son called Nicomachus. Around this time, Aristotle opens his own school, the Lyceum. The next 11 years are the most productive of his life:  	-	Invented or discovered logic
	-   Wrote 'Physics' and created that discipline. 
	-   Wrote 'Rhetoric' and created that discipline
	-   Wrote 'On Meteorology' and new discipline. 	-	Advanced well beyond what in many ways what was to become natural science	-	Did a great deal on questions in what he calls “ethics”

In 323 BCE, Alexander dies, which makes Aristotle vulnerable in Athens. In 322 BCE, he was charged with impiety, a standard way for Athenians to get rid of those they dislike. Aristotle flees but only lives a year before dying at 61.



## Reading Aristotle

Unfortunately, none of Aristotle's published worked survived from his time. What we have is Andronicus’ edition (1st. C. BCE), which he compiled two hundred years after Aristotle lived. This writing is highly condensed, and it is most likely Aristotle's notes that he drafted over time. While he may have shared these with his students, he did not prepare them for public consumption. Alas, they are incredibly difficult to read. Our job is more like that of miners or archeologists. There are nuggets of gold in the writing that has survived, but we have to dig to find them.
