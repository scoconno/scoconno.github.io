# Short Essay 2

## The Inventory of Being
God has given you a tough task. You must create a great inventory of being! In that inventory, you must list every kind of thing that exists, has existed, and will exist. Some of the work is easy. Planets, animals, atoms, and trees. They all clearly exist, but what about universals, mathematical entities, and race? 

To make it worse, God doesn't want all those entities that seem to depend on human cognition and practice. Only mind independent entities should be included! You are convinced at least one of these entities does exist.


## Task

Pick either **universals**, **mathematical entities**, or **race**. 

+ Provide the best argument that your chosen entity exists, i.e., belongs to the great inventory of mind-independent reality.   

**NB:** 1) Pick the strongest argument for the existence of your chosen entity; don't summarize all the arguments that have been given. 2) Don't discuss any argument against your chosen entity. 3) Don't attempt to argue that your entity is a mind-dependent entity! 

## Word Count

250-500 words long. Essays shorter than 250 words or longer than 500 words will lose points.

## Due Date

Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.


## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.

## Format

Submit your work by first clicking on the relevant assignment in Blackboard. Click on ‘browse computer’ and upload your document as a .doc, .rtf, or .pdf file. Please use ‘attach document’. Do not send it to me by e-mail or through Blackboard’s messaging application.
