### Introduction


The year is 2040 and you receive a summons; you are being sued for unpaid student loans. Apparently, someone with the same name as you took out loans while studying at New Jersey City University twenty-five years ago. You are furious! Same name or not, you are not that person who borrowed money for their studies. You will fight the law suit by using the Debtor's Paradox (also called the Paradox of Increase) to prove that you are not identical to the student who borrowed that money. 


### Task
Write a letter to the courts and loan company using the Debtor's Paradox to argue that you are not identical to the person who borrowed the money and so are not required to repay them. 


### Word Count

250-500 words long. Essays shorter than 250 words or longer than 500 words will lose points.

### Due Date

Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.


### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.

### Format

Submit your work by first clicking on the relevant assignment in Blackboard. Click on ‘browse computer’ and upload your document as a .doc, .rtf, or .pdf file. Please use ‘attach document’. Do not send it to me by e-mail or through Blackboard’s messaging application.
