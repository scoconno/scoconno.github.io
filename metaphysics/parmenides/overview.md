## Aristotle background
+ Born in Stagira in Macedonia around 384 BCE
+ Macedonia is far North of Greece
+ Father was a physician at the Macedonian court. 
+ Moved to Athens at the age of 17 to study at Plato’s Academy in 367 BCE
	+ 470/69 BCE: Socrates is born in Athens
	+ 428/27 BCE: Plato is born, studies with Socrates
	+ 399 BCE: Socrates is executed for impiety and corrupting the
    youth of Athens
	+ 387 BCE: Plato establishes the Academy
+ Athens was the cultural, political, and financial capital of the Mediterranean. 

In the fifth and fourth centuries, during the lifetimes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, Athens was an independent state consisting of the urban area and the surrounding rural areas of Attica. (The total population is difficult to estimate. It may have had about 20,000 citizens; see below on the definition of ‘citizen’.) Other Greek cities were allies of or subordinate to Athens; the Athenian alliance was opposed to a roughly similar alliance of other Greek cities led by Sparta.

Aristotle was not a citizen of Athens, and his relationship with the Athenians wasn't an easy one. Athens (like some other Greek cities, but by no means all) had a democratic constitution. The Greek ‘dêmokratia’ is derived from ‘kratos’ (power) and ‘dêmos’ (used both for ‘the people’ as a whole, and in a more specific sense for the lower classes); hence it indicates that power belonged to the people as a whole, rather than to a particular class. Greek democracy was significantly different from the representative system that we are used to calling ‘democracy’.  (The Greeks would have regarded the present US constitution as a form of ‘oligarchy’ – literally ‘rule by the few’.)  It involved ‘direct’ democracy, in so far as the most important decisions were taken by a mass meeting of all citizens.

Aristotle Was known as the “brain of the academy”. None of his writings from that time survive. Nevertheless, when in 347 BCE, Plato dies and Philip of Macedonia overthrows Athenian allies, Aristotle is not made head of the academy. He flees with other academics to Assos on the North Aegean Coast of Turkey. The Persian war forces him to retreat to the island of lesbos. There he marries Pythias, the adoptive daugther of King Hermias. He begins his life long love of biology. One third of his writing is about Biology; Pythias was accomplished in her own right.  

Phillip II invites Aristotle back to Macedonia to tutor his son, Alexander. Alexander became the Alexander the Great. He conquered North Africa, middle East, Iran, really all of  west Asia, and all the way to North India. He was attempting to conquer the entire world, and he was surprised by his failure. But his failure is deeply important for understanding the spread of Greek culture in general and Aristotelian philosophy in particular. There are two reasons for this. First, he spread Greek culture far beyond Athen, most importantly he spread the teachings of his beloved Aristotle. Second, he made available to Aristotle the largest empire ever known to assist Aristotle in his work. Aristotle, for instance, intended to learn about every bird, plant, fish, mammal, etc., and Alexander made available tens of thousands of soldiers, farmers, etc., to compile reports, send samples, etc. 

In 334 BCE, Aristotle returns to Athens under the protection of Amtipater who had been appointed by Alexander to rule Athens. Aristotle has a daughter at this time named Pythia after his wife, but his wife dies. He marries another woman Herpyllis and has a son called Nicomachus. Around this time, Aristotle opens his own school, the Lyceum. The next 11 years are the most productive of his life:  	-	Invented or discovered logic
	-   Wrote 'Physics' and created that discipline. 
	-   Wrote 'Rhetoric' and created that discipline
	-   Wrote 'On Meteorology' and new discipline. 	-	Advanced well beyond what in many ways what was to become natural science	-	Did a great deal on questions in what he calls “ethics”

In 323 BCE, Alexander dies, which makes Aristotle vulnerable in Athens. In 322 BCE, he was charged with impiety, a standard way for Athenians to get rid of those they dislike. Aristotle flees but only lives a year before dying at 61


## Important lessons from his biography

Aristotle is the son of a physician, a doctor. He shares from his father a deep interest in the empirical world, both in what he wants to study and how he studies it. For the former, his overarching passion is biology, where this includes studying the characteristic behaviors, parts, and appearances of different species of animals. For the latter, Aristotle studied many topics empirically. For instance, he dissects animals and gets his hands 'dirty.'

Being the son of a physician effected how Aristotle approached philosophy. Suppose a biologist learns about a new species. Let us give it the name Gothica. We would like to know what it is for a Gothica to live a good life? Would they, for instance, suffer if we place them in a zoo? What about building a pipeline through their habitat? Socrates might try answer these questions by talking to experts. Plato might investigate these questions by thinking abstractly about the perfect Gothica. 

Aristotle would instead observing what these animals do. He would watch the activities they perform. He would also observe what's unique or different about these animals. Finally, he would dissect the Gothicas, looking inside them.


When we turn to Aristotle's ethics, we will see he wants to know what a worthwhile human life is? But he has no  truck for people who think only about religion, or philosophy, or generally ignore human beings. His starting point is, he thinks, the obvious fact that there are humans living and attempting to live worthwhile lives. But just as not every Gothica lives a good Gothica life---perhaps it sits around on a log all day while his friends flourish, not all human lives are worthwhile. So, we're going to look at the beliefs and desires that people really have. We're also going to look at the things that they really pursue. We're going to take all that data has our starting points. 


## Reading Aristotle

Unfortunately, none of Aristotle's published worked survived from his time. What we have is Andronicus’ edition (1st. C. BCE), which he compiled two hundred years after Aristotle lived. This writing is highly condensed, and it is most likely Aristotle's notes that he drafted over time. While he may have shared these with his students, he did not prepare them for public consumption. Alas, they are incredibly difficult to read. Our job is more like that of miners or archeologists. There are nuggets of gold in the writing that has survived, but we have to dig to find them. 



Aristotle left Athens around the time Plato died, in 348 or 347 B.C.E. One explanation is that as a resident alien, Aristotle was excluded from leadership of the Academy in favor of Plato’s nephew, the Athenian citizen Speusippus. Another possibility is that Aristotle was forced to flee as Philip of Macedon’s expanding power led to the spread of anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens (Chroust 1967). Whatever the cause, Aristotle subsequently moved to Atarneus, which was ruled by another former student at the Academy, Hermias. During his three years there, Aristotle married Pythias, the niece or adopted daughter of Hermias, and perhaps engaged in negotiations or espionage on behalf of the Macedonians (Chroust 1972). Whatever the case, the couple relocated to Macedonia, where Aristotle was employed by Philip, serving as tutor to his son, Alexander the Great (DL 5.1.3–4). Aristotle’s philosophical career was thus directly entangled with the rise of a major power.

After some time in Macedonia, Aristotle returned to Athens, where he founded his own school in rented buildings in the Lyceum. It was presumably during this period that he authored most of his surviving texts, which have the appearance of lecture transcripts edited so they could be read aloud in Aristotle’s absence. Indeed, this must have been necessary, since after his school had been in operation for thirteen years, he again departed from Athens, possibly because a charge of impiety was brought against him (DL 5.1.5). He died at age 63 in Chalcis (DL 5.1.10).

Diogenes tells us that Aristotle was a thin man who dressed flashily, wearing a fashionable hairstyle and a number of rings. If the will quoted by Diogenes (5.1.11–16) is authentic, Aristotle must have possessed significant personal wealth, since it promises a furnished house in Stagira, three female slaves, and a talent of silver to his concubine, Herpyllis. Aristotle fathered a daughter with Pythias and, with Herpyllis, a son, Nicomachus (named after his grandfather), who may have edited Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. Unfortunately, since there are few extant sources on Aristotle’s life, one’s judgment about the accuracy and completeness of these details depends largely on how much one trusts Diogenes’ testimony.
