title: Responses to Parmenides
---

People were aware of Parmenides challenge. They wanted to describe a world of change. They took care to avoid their own views in a way that allowed htem to avoid his objections.


Empedocles

Fools those who think that something comes from what is not or that somethng is generated and destroyed. 
Agreed that no generation and perishing because both involved what is not. 

Empedocles 
It is impossible to come to be from what in now way is. And things don't perish absolutely.

'What is no way is'. 
'Perishing absolutely'


Anaxagoras, 
Empedocles
Atomists

Change invoves coming to be from what is not
We cannot think about what is not
So, change is unthinkable. 


One Simple Response: not all denials are denials of existence.


+ The statement that Socrates **is musical** should not be analyzed as referring to the musicality of Socrates and saying of it that it exists.
+ Likeweise, the statement that Socrates **is not musical** should not be analyzed as referring to the musicality of Socrates and saying that it does not exist.

**Summary:* Claims that x is not P are not equivalent to denials of existence.





The Poem begins: 

- Maiden daughters of Helios, the sun God. 
- Justice is the God who guards the gates
- Going to Nyx, the Goddess of night, the points where Helios and Nyx cross paths.



Parmenides claims that there are only  two logically coherent possibilities in any inquiry – that the subject of the enquiry exists or it does not exist. He rules out the latter as unlearnable. 

What does this mean? When you begin an inquiry, you must hold an object of thought firmly in your mind and ask questions about it. You might ask things like, does it exist or not? He thinks that you cannot even entertain the possibility that the thing cannot exist and so cannot even try answer the question.

## Thought

- one cannot refer to what is not there to refer to.

- Compare: trying to see something that is not there to be seen. It is impossible. It is true that you might hallucinate a dolphin, but there was a hallucination to see. Imagine if there were both no dolphin and no hallucination. The he would not see anything at all.

- Well, reasons Parmenides (though not, of course, with Hamlet in mind), why should speech or thought be any different? We cannot see what is not there to be seen, so why should we be able to refer to what is not there to be referred to? If something does not exist, in other words, we cannot think about it and we cannot speak about it.

- Because of this profound link between thinking and being, Parmenides claims we cannot make any statements of non-being. So we cannot, for instance, speak about unicorns, even to say that they do not exist. In fact, we can never claim that anything does not exist, because anything that does not exist cannot be spoken about.



## The Way of Truth M


KRS: in fr.2 the Goddess was specifying logically coherent alternatives between which rational enquirers must decide. “The third way is simply the path you will find yourself following if, like the generality of mortals, you do not take that decision through failure to use your critical powers. You will find yourself saying or implying both that a thing is and that it is not (e.g. by acknowledging change and coming into existence); and so you will wander helplessly from one of the ways distinguished in 291 to the other.”p247

(iii) Signs of truth. 
1)	that being and uncreated and imperishable it is
2)	whole of a single kind 
3)	unshaken 
4)	perfect.

The signs constitute formal requirements which any subject of enquiry must satisfy. 

Upshot of Parmenides’ argument is a form of monism: everything there is must have one and the same character; and it is doubtful whether in fact anything could have that character except reality as a whole. 

(iii) (a) Uncreated and imperishable. 
Fr. 8: ‘It never was nor will be, since it is now, all together one, continuous.’
I’m not sure my interpretation will work. I want to say if x is(e) F, then it could not be otherwise. But surely it was(e) F and will(e) be F. Well, wait, Parmenides could be just saying that it is not the case that now [it] which is no longer now, was before now. And likewise with will. So he might not be talking about something that is now and was also before and will be. But what about the qualification.
But he does speak about being completely – funky. 

He asks ‘how could what is be in the future’. He must be assuming that if something is in the future then it should not be now. This is surely absurd on an existential reading. But it makes sense on a Curd readings. The point is that this thing now x (which is F) could not be G in the future. Or maybe, this thing now x is a being now, so how it could it be the case that now it will only have its essence in the future. 

These lines are meant to show that what is cannot come to be or perish. 

(iii) (b) One and continuous. 
KRS thinks that Parmenides intends to show that all reality is one by this thesis. I’m not sure. 

Nor is it divided, since it all exists alike; nor is it more here and less there which would prevent it from holding together, but it is all full of being. So it is all continuous: for what is draws near to what is. 

The reference here looks like the sortal or form. He is claiming it is homogenous. The ‘all full of being’, I think suggests that whatever the subject is has no lack or non-being. 

(iii) (c) Unchangeable. 
So he says that it is not just imperishable and doesn’t come to be but also does not alter. Interesting that he has two notions of change. 

(iii) (d) Perfect.
What is should not be imperfect (think Nehamas)
“The same thing is there to be thought and is why there is thought.”

Mortal Opinions.

When you think, you think of something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something. Therefore both thought and language require objects outside themselves. And since you can think of a thing or speak of it at one time as well as another, whatever can be thought of or spoken of must exist at all times. Consequently there can be no change, since change consists in things coming into being or ceasing to be (Russell 1945, 49).
