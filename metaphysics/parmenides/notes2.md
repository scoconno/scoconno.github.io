title: Responses to Parmenides
---

Parmenides' challenge was felt acutely. Scientists, natural philosophers, insisted that the world of change existed.  But, they recognized that they needed to describe a world of change that could avoid Parmenides' challenge. So, they took care to articulate their own views in a way that allowed them to avoid the implication that 'what is not' is, i.e., they articulated accounts of change and the changing world while avoiding saying and thinking about what is not. One interesting feature of these research projects is how radical the positions were that one needed to adopt to avoid Parmenides' challenge; Parmenides' predecessors rescued the world of change in ways that still questioned the veracity of the world of appearance. This table summarizes the various ways Parmenides' predecessors differed from him.

We are going to treat Empedocles and the atomists as a group. We will focus on Aristotle on Wednesday. 

## The verb to be 

> For it is impossible to come to be from **what in no way is**, and it is not to be accomplished and is unheard of that what is **perishes absolutely**. (Empedocles, B12)

The verb 'to be' can be used in different ways. One of the central responses to Parmenides is to exploit these different ways to identify mistakes in his argument. The two ways are what we call the 'existential' and the 'predicative' uses of the verb. Compare the following: 


+ Socrates is not at all. *vs*
+ Socrates is not short.

+ There is no chocolate in the fridge. *vs*
+ The chocolate is not cheap.

+ 'To be or not to be.' (Hamlet)
+ 'Do you want to be a doctor or a lawyer?'

The predicative use of 'to be', the copula, always requires some complement. For instance, if I intend the copula, the following are incomplete sentences: 

+ Socrates is___
+ Socrates is not___
+ I am___
+ I am not___

The existential sense of the verb 'to be' does not need a complement to form a sentence. We can mark this by replacing 'is' with exists. Consider: 

+ I exist.
+ Socrates does not exist. 

It makes not sense to say, 'I exist doctor'. The distinction between the existential and predicative uses of 'to be' allows us to read in different ways Parmenides' primary injunction against thinking about what is not. 

+ It is impossible to think about what does not exist. 
+ It is impossible to think about what does not have any property. 
+ It is impossible to think about what does not have some property.

If something does not exist, then perhaps we will agree with Parmenides that it cannot be a possible object of thought. And, if an object has no property whatsoever, then it does not exist. So, such things too could not be possible objects of thought. However, it does not follow that an object lacks some specific property, that it does not exist. For instance, it does not follow from the fact that Socrates is not red that Socrates does not exist. Socrates failing to be red is compatible with him having plenty of other properties, e.g., he is human, tall, Greek, etc. So, the fact Socrates fails to have one property does not entail that he is not a possible object of thought. 

## Empedocles
Empedocles responds to Parmenides with a concession and a rebuttal. To articulate the repsonse, let us consider Parmenides' argument against the reality of change in the following way:

+ P1. Change involves coming to be from what is not
+ P2. We cannot think about what is not
+ C. So, change is unthinkable. 

I just suggested that P2 should be read with the existential version of 'to be'. So, it should be read as follows:

+ P1*. Change involves coming to exist from what does not exist. 
+ P2*. We cannot think about what does not exist. 
+ C*. So, change is unthinkable. 

Empedocles agree with P2. He agrees, in effect, that change is impossible if it involves coming to be from what does not exist. This is why Empedocles denies that there is any generation or destruction: 

> ...There is coming to be of not a single one of all mortal things, nor is there any end of deadly death ....(Empedocles B8)

This is a reasonable point to make if we assume that Socrates' generation involves Socrates changing from not-existing to existing. Socrates' generation, then, would involve Socrates coming to exist from what does not exist. A similar argument can be run for destruction. 

Empedocles agrees with Parmenides on this point; that there is no generation or destruction. But, he denies that every change involves coming from what does not exist. Many changes, Empedocles, claims are best described as coming from what is not F. For instance, Socrates music lesson is best described as Socates becoming musical from being unmusical. His catching a cold is best described as Socrates becoming sick from being healthy. The descriptions of these changes use the predicative sense of 'to be' and not the existential sense of the verb. 

+ P1**. Change invovles coming to be F from what is not F.
+ P2**. We cannot think about what does not exist. 
+ C**. So, change is unthinkable. 

Note here that the argument is not valid; the conclusion does not follow from the premises. It is analagous to the following argument: 

+ Every bank is adjacent to some river.
+ The Chase building on Lexington and 72nd is a bank. 
+ Thererfore, the Chase building is adjacent to some river. 

Obviously, this is invalid because it confuses two meanings of the word, 'bank'. There is a difference between money banks and river banks. 

## Empedocles positive theory


> Hear first the four roots of all things: Shining Zeus [fire] and life-bringing Hera [air] and Aidoneus [earth] and Nestis [water] who with her tears moistens mortal Springs. (B6)

> And these [sc. the elements] never cease continually interchanging, at one time all coming together into one by Love, and at another each being borne apart by the hatred of Strife. (43=B17, line 6)




| Active Principles  | Passive Principles  | 
| :--------: |:-------:|
| Love | Earth    |   
| Strife  | Fire     | 
| | Water  |   
| | Air |   


...For there are just these things [i.e., the four elements], and running through one another they come to be both humans and the tribes of other beasts at one time coming together into a single cosmos by Love and at another each being borne apart by the hatred of Strife .... (48=B26)

> Whenever they [sc. the elements] arrive in the aither mixed so as to form a man or one of the wild beasts or bushes or birds, that is when <people> speak of coming into being; and whenever they are separated, that <is what they call> the ill-starred fate of death. They do not call it as is right, but I myself too assent to their convention. (B9).

> There is ... only mixture, and separation of what is mixed, and nature [or, birth, phusis] is the name given to them by humans. (B8)

> For from these [sc. the elements] come all things that were and are and will be in the future. Trees have sprouted and men and women, and beasts and birds and fishes nurtured in water, and long-lived gods highest in honors. For there are just these things [i.e., the elements], and running through one another they come to have different appearances, for mixture changes them. (B21)

> Pleasant earth in her well made crucibles obtained two parts of bright Nestis out of the eight, and four of Hephaestus, and white bones came into being, fitted together divinely by the glues of Harmonia. (B96)
