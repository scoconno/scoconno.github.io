# Potential and Actual Being


Consider the ingredients for a cake sitting on your kitchen counter. These ingredients, for Aristotle, are not actually a cake yet. They are potentially a cake. This notion between actual and potential is Aristotle's; these English words are translations of Greek words that Aristotle coined. Central to Aristotle's metaphysics is a distinction between potential beings and actual beings. There is a difference between being potentially a house and being actually a house; being potentially a dog and being actually a dog; being potentially seeing and being actually seeing.

What exactly is this difference? Why are the ingredients on my kitchen counter potentially a cake but not potentially a house? Aristotle does not think that facts about potential beings can be reduced to facts solely about actual beings. For example, he does not think that the fact that a collection of bricks constitutes a potential house can be reduced solely to facts about bricks.

Rather, Aristotle thinks that a being (or collection of beings) X is (are) a potential *F* if and only if there is a single process such that, as a result of undergoing that process, X is actually *F*. For example, the reason why those ingredients are potentially a cake is because there is a single process, namely an exercise of the art of baking, that it can undergo to turn them into an actual cake. Likewise, a collection of bricks constitute a potential house because there is a single process, namely an exercise of the art of housebuilding, that it can undergo such that it becomes an actual house.

Aristotle develops his account by distinguishing types of actuality and potentiality. To illustrate this distinction, consider whether you can speak Ancient Greek? Can you do this? This question admits of two different answers depending on what we mean by 'can'. It could mean, 'do you know how to speak Greek such that you could start speaking it whenever you choose?' Alternatively, it could mean, 'do you have the appropriate physical and intellectual capacities to allow you speak Greek?' The answer to the latter is clearly 'yes'. Dogs do not have the physique and minds for Greek, but humans do. But while the answer to the second question might be 'yes', the answer to the first might be 'no'.

In Aristotle's words, such a person has the first potential for Greek but not the second potential. Once they acquire the knowledge of Greek, they will become actual Greek speakers. They will also have what is called the 'second potential' for Greek, namely, they can now speak Greek whenever the choose. When they do, in fact, exercise their knowledge of Greek and speak it, they will be Greek speakers in a different way, namely, they will be second actuality Greek speakers.

## When is Socrates potentially alive? 

Aristotle believes that some matter is potentially a human; Socrates' generation involves some matter changing from being potentially a human to being actually a human. I want to emphasize that first, and foremost, the primary motivation for such an account is to explain generation in a way that responds to Parmenides. If there is a better solution to Parmenides, or if it turns out that we can think and speak about what is not, then the very motivation for potential being is rendered mute; you will not have sufficient reason that Socrates ever exists in potentiality. 

Thus, Aristotle's general account of soul: the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. In other words, the soul just is the integrated set of abilities the possession of which makes a living organism the kind of organism it is. The nutritive soul is akin to the knowledge of Greek. Just as the knowledge of Greek, allows for the actual exercise of Greek speaking, so too the nutritive soul allows for the actual exercise of nutrition.\
This means that Aristotle does *not* distinguish between the various kinds of activities human beings engage in and attribute a subset of them to the soul and a subset to something else (such as the body). But,
it does *not* mean that Aristotle can't make distinctions between
various activities human beings can perform when such a distinction is
relevant (e.g. he can think that the purely automatic maintenance of the
body isn't relevant for Ethics or practical philosophy).\
The ability to perform the activities of nutrition can be had without
the abilities to perceive and think (e.g. in plants); the ability to
perceive can be had without the ability to think but *not* without the
ability to nourish; the ability to think requires all the others (at
least for earthly organisms).\
As noted above, Aristotle thinks that there can be a general definition
of soul as such (given above), but that general account is not that
informative. In part, this is because the possession of higher-order
abilities "colors" or "affects" the lower-order abilities of the
organism. For example, possessing the ability to think means that the
human beings ability to nourish itself is quite different from, say,
plants or animals ability to nourish itself.\
This is part of the reason why Aristotle thinks that virtue (and ethics
generally) is something that only human beings can possess; it isn't
just that we possess the ability to think; its because our possessing
that ability means we can perform the lower-order abilities in a manner
not available to non-human animals.

The soul as *aitia* {#the-soul-as-aitia .unnumbered}
===================

In Ch. 4 Aristotle says that the soul is the *aitia* in three ways of the organism whose soul it is: as source of motion, what it is for, and substance (i.e. form)

-   Efficient *aitia* of the locomotion, growth, and alteration of the organism
-   Formal *aitia* of the organism (i.e. it makes the organism the kind of organism it is)
-   Final *aitia* of the organism's "body" (i.e. its parts are for the sake of performing those abilities)
