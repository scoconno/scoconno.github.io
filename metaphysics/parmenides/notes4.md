# Potential and Actual Being

Everything is generated from some pre-existing thing and passes away into some existing things. This is a core claim that Aristotle uses in arguing that we need not describe generation as an entity coming from not-existing at all. Philosophers generally agree with Aristotle that there can be no generation ex-nihilo, that entities cannot be generated from nothing whatsoever. Generally, they agree that the creation of a new entities involves some prior-existing thing, call it matter, undergoing some process or other. But this raises a host of questions including just when a new entity is generated in such a process. The hardest cases involve organisms, and our focus will be when in the generative process a new life begins. For instance, just when in the generative process is a new dolphin created? If we are unable to answer this question, if we are unable to explain how a new dolphin could be generated from some prior existing material, then Aristotle's general response to Parmenides will fail. And so it is this discuss we now turn.

In order to know when a new life begins, and indeed just how new life could emerge something pre-existing, we need to first get clearer about what life is and what it is to live. 

## What is life? 

In the *De Anima*, Aristotle develops a theory of the soul and life. *De Anima* is a Latin title for the work, and No english translation is really suitable. The English 'soul' has religious connotations. Many religious thinkers view it as the seat of consciousness that carries the marks of the moral decisions made in a person's life. But Aristotle's view of the soul is radically different. The soul, for Aristotle, is that which animates a body, i.e., it gives life to a body. It does so by making a body the kind of living body that it is. The soul of a plant makes a particular body into a living body that can take in nutriment, grow and reproduce. The soul of an animal makes a a particular body into a living body that can move and perceive its environment. So, Aristotle's core notion of soul is deeply related to what makes a body alive, and, especially to what makes it the kind of living thing it is.

Aristotle, then, denies that life is univocal notion. According to Aristotle, to ask whether something is alive is to ask whether it can engage in one of several discrete activities. These are as follows: 

-   Self-nourishment

-   Growth

-   Decay (aging)

-   Self movement and rest (in respect of place)

-   Perception

-   Intellect

So anything that nourishes itself, that grows, decays, can move itself, perceives, or thinks is alive. But each of these activities is unique, and there is no one notion of being alive other than each living thing can do at least one of these things. 

Why can certain bodies engage in these activities while others cannot? Why can a plant grow but not move? Aristotle's answer relies on his core notion of soul. According to him, the soul's presence in a body explains why that body is able to engage in the kind of activities that it can, and, in doing so, it simultaneously explains both why a body is alive and why it is the kind of living thing that it is. Aristotle divides these kinds into three wide groups:

Plants:

:   They only have **nutritive souls**. Such souls explain why plans can engage in growth and nutrition.

Animals:

:   They have **sensitive souls**. Such souls explain why plants can engage in locomotion and perception.

Human being:

:   They have **rational souls**. Such souls explain why humans can thing.

Aristotle thinks that there is a nested hierarchy between these souls. They are nested in the sense that anything that has a higher degree of soul also has all of the lower degrees. All living things grow, nourish themselves, and reproduce. Animals not only do that, but move and perceive. Humans do all of the above and reason, as well. (There are further subdivisions within the various levels, which we will ignore.)

While the core notion is simple enough, Aristotle's sophisticated
development is anything but simple. He develops an account of how soul explains the activities of a living body by deploying not just the notion of form and matter from the *Physics*, but a new and difficulty distinction between what he calls actuality and potentiality.

> It is necessary, then, that the soul is a substance as the form of a natural body which has life in potentiality. But substance is actuality; hence, the soul will be an actuality of a certain sort of body. (DA 412a 19--22)

At the beginning of Ch.Â 1, Aristotle tells us that the soul is a
particular kind of nature, namely the form of a living organism; thus, the relation of body to soul is an instance of the more general form-matter relationship. But he adds something new. He says that soul is the actuality of a certain sort of body. He will ultimately claim that the soul is a second potentiality / first
actuality of a certain kind of body. The kind of body at question is "organic" (composed of organs), i.e. one's whose parts are capable of functioning in integrated ways. For example, the leaves, roots, stem etc., of plants are capable of functioning in various integrated ways.

## When does life begin? 

Disambiguating these notions of life are helpful in giving an account of life is; we just need to give an account of each of these activities. It also helps us in answering our question in when life begins. That question can only be answered by determining, for instance, when perception begins. Likewise, determining when a plan is generated during the generative process requires identifying when growth, self-nourishment, etc., begins. Aristotle's answer to when such activities begin is that they begin when some pre-existing material can start to engage them. Explaining this requires introducing his notion of potentiality and actuality. 

Consider the ingredients for a cake sitting on your kitchen counter. These ingredients are not actually a cake yet. They are potentially a cake. This notion between actual and potential is Aristotle's; these English words are translations of Greek words that Aristotle coined. Central to Aristotle's metaphysics is a distinction between potential beings and actual beings. There is a difference between being potentially a house and being actually a house; being potentially a dog and being actually a dog; being potentially seeing and being actually seeing.

What exactly is this difference? Why are the ingredients on my kitchen counter potentially a cake but not potentially a house? Aristotle does not think that facts about potential beings can be reduced to facts solely about actual beings. For example, he does not think that the fact that a collection of bricks constitutes a potential house can be reduced solely to facts about bricks.

Rather, Aristotle thinks that a being (or collection of beings) X is (are) a potential *F* if and only if there is a single process such that, as a result of undergoing that process, X is actually *F*. For example, the reason why those ingredients are potentially a cake is because there is a single process, namely an exercise of the art of baking, that can turn them into an actual cake. Likewise, a collection of bricks constitutes a potential house because there is a single process, namely an exercise of the art of housebuilding, that can undergo such that it becomes an actual house.

Aristotle develops his account by distinguishing types of actuality and potentiality, between first and second potentiality on the one hand and first and second potentiality on the other. To illustrate this distinction, consider whether you can speak Ancient Greek? Can you do this? This question admits of two different answers depending on what we mean by 'can'. It could mean, 'do you know how to speak Greek such that you could start speaking it whenever you choose?' Alternatively, it could mean, 'do you have the appropriate physical and intellectual capacities to allow you speak Greek?' The answer to the latter is clearly 'yes' even if the answer to the prior question is no. In contrast, dogs can neither open their mouths to speak Greek nor do they have the capacity to learn it; they do not have the physique and minds for Greek. 

In Aristotle's words, a person yet to learn Greek has the first potential for Greek but not the second potential. Once they acquire the knowledge of Greek, they will become actual Greek speakers. They will also have what is called the 'second potential' for Greek, namely, they can now speak Greek whenever the choose. When they do, in fact, exercise their knowledge of Greek and speak it, they will be Greek speakers in a different way, namely, they will be second actuality Greek speakers.

## When is Socrates potentially alive? 

Aristotle believes that some matter is potentially a human; Flipper's generation involves some matter changing from being potentially a dolphin to being actually a dolphin. So to determine when he is generated, we need to ask when there existed some pre-existing material that was potentially a dolphin, i.e., had to potential to do all the things characteristic of dolphin life above. 

Focus on perception. At what point in the generative process did there exist some material with the potential to see, hear, etc? There are two types of potentiality. So this question could be asking at what point did there exist some material that could be turned into a something that could actually see, hear, etc? Or it could be asking when does some material have the capacity to engage in these activities?
 

We
Thus, Aristotle's general account of soul: the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. In other words, the soul just is the integrated set of abilities the possession of which makes a living organism the kind of organism it is. The nutritive soul is akin to the knowledge of Greek. Just as the knowledge of Greek, allows for the actual exercise of Greek speaking, so too the nutritive soul allows for the actual exercise of nutrition.\
This means that Aristotle does *not* distinguish between the various kinds of activities human beings engage in and attribute a subset of them to the soul and a subset to something else (such as the body). But, it does *not* mean that Aristotle can't make distinctions between various activities human beings can perform when such a distinction is relevant (e.g. he can think that the purely automatic maintenance of the body isn't relevant for Ethics or practical philosophy).\

The ability to perform the activities of nutrition can be had without the abilities to perceive and think (e.g. in plants); the ability to perceive can be had without the ability to think but *not* without the ability to nourish; the ability to think requires all the others (at least for earthly organisms).\
As noted above, Aristotle thinks that there can be a general definition of soul as such (given above), but that general account is not that informative. In part, this is because the possession of higher-order abilities "colors" or "affects" the lower-order abilities of the organism. For example, possessing the ability to think means that the human beings ability to nourish itself is quite different from, say, plants or animals ability to nourish itself.
