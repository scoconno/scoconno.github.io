title: Parmenides' Challenge

---

Parmenides of Elea, current day Italy, was active in the earlier part of the 5th c. BCE. He is part of a school of philosophy called the *Eleatics*. We will learn about his student Zeno later in the course. 


'On Nature', the work we are studying, was written in hexameter verse, a standard meter for poems of this type. Homer's *Odyssey*, for instance, was written in hexameter. We will study the poem in translation, but it is near impossible to recreate this particular Greek meter in English. So, keep in mind two things: 1) the translation of ancient Greek is not easy and  the translation of several passages is contested, 2) Parmenides intended his readers to hear this as a poem. 

Here is what the poem looks like in the original Greek. 


> 1. Ἵπποι, ταί με φέρουσιν, ὅσον τ ̓ ἐπὶ θυμὸς ἱκάνοι 
2.  πέμπον, ἐπεί μ ̓ ἐς ὁδὸν βῆσαν πολύφημον ἄγουσαι     
3. δαίμονος, ἣ κατὰ πάντ ̓ ἄ<ν>τη<ν> φέρει εἰδότα φῶτα·     
4. τῇ φερόμην, τῇ γάρ με πολύφραστοι φέρον ἵπποι    5. ἅρμα τιταίνουσαι, κοῦραι δ ̓ ὁδὸν ἡγεμόνευον.   
6. ἄξων δ ̓ ἐν χνοίῃσιν ἵ<ει> σύριγγος ἀυτὴν  
7. αἰθόμενος, δοιοῖς γὰρ ἐπείγετο δινωτοῖσιν  
8. κύκλοις ἀμφοτέρωθεν, ὅτε σπερχοίατο πέμπειν  
9. ἡλιάδες κοῦραι προλιποῦσαι δώματα νυκτὸς  10. ἐς φάος, ὠσάμεναι κράτων ἄπο χερσὶ καλύπτρας.

Unfortunately, the full poem has not survived. What has survived are various fragments that have been copied and passed on. These fragments allow us a good understand of the poem, which is now standardly taken to have contained three parts. The first part is called the 'proem', a kind of introductory phase in which Parmenides describes a mystical trip to the halls of a Goddess, most likely the Goddess Nyx (night). The Goddess describes to Parmenides three roads of inquiry and argues that only one road will lead to the truth. The second part of the poem argues that the road of truth involves inquiry into 'what is' or 'being'. Two other roads are rejected, inquiry into 'what is not' or 'non-being' and the inquiry into 'what is and is not', the road of mortals. Whatever the correct the interpretation, the Goddess thinks that any judgement that concerns either directly or indirectly non-being is false. The third part of the poem concerns the way humans normally think the universe and everything in it comes into being and passes away. I do not include that below.  


Summary

1. He wants to argue that nothing can (i) be created or destroyed, (ii) alter, grow, or, move, (iii) be divided into parts (iv) be incomplete, i.e., lacking in some size. 
2. He wants to argue that since i-iv are true, the only thing that exists is being itself that lacks these tratits. This is called monism. 
3. His argument for 1 relies on the claim that each predicate, or property, would entail the existence of non-being, i.e., a location that the sphere is not, a time when the baby is not.
4. His argument against non-being relies on some relationship between thought/language and its referents. 



We want to understand 4, before seeing how he can use it to support 1. 



## Argument for 1

1. A thing can be thought about only if it is possible for it to exist. 
2. Anything that does not exist, cannot exist. 
3. Therefore, anything that can exist, does exist...from 2.
4. Therefore, a thing can be thought about only if it exists...from 1 and 3
5. Therefore, anything that does not exist, cannot be thought about....from 4



> When you think, you think of something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something. Therefore both thought and language require objects outside themselves. 



+ A name is meaningful only if it refers to something that possible exists. 
+ A proposition/sentence is meaningful only if the names within the sentence are meaningful.
+ A proposition is true/false only if it is meaningful



*Examples*

+ Santa-Clause

+ Easter Bunny

+ 'Santa Clause lives in the North Pole'

+ 'Socrates lives in Hades'

  ​

  **Or perhaps this is the worry**

+ Is the sentence 'Santa Clause does not exist' true? 

+ To be true, it must be meaningful. 

+ To be meaningful, the names must refer. 

+ If 'Santa Clause' refers, Santa Clause exists. 

+ If Santa Clause exists, the sentence 'Santa Clause does not exist' is false.

+ If  Santa Claus does not exist, the sentence 'Santa Clause does not exist' is not meaningful, and thus neither true nor false

+ General  idea: you cannot both meaningfully assert that something does not exist and, at the same time, be speaking truly. 

>    “*x* does not exist” is not true unless *x* does not exist. But if the subject of a statement does not exist, the statement is not meaningful. The problem with negative existentials is this: a necessary condition of their truth is a sufficient condition of their meaninglessness.


## Upshot

1. x can be *successfully* thought and/or talked about if and only if x exists.

2. If x does not exist, then x cannot be *successfully* thought and/or talked about.

3. If x does not exist and you believe that you have *successfully* thought or talked about x, then your belief is false. 





## Signs of Truth



### 1. Generation & Destruction

+ If Socrates comes into existence, then he comes into existence from either (1) previously not-existing or (ii) previously existing.

+ (ii) is not a genuine case of coming into existence. 

+ (i) is impossible

  + If Socrates comes from a time when he, Socrates, did not exist, then it must be possible to think and say that there is a time when Socrates did not exist. 

  + It is impossible to think and say that Socrates did not exist (for it is impossible to think and say that anything does not exist)



Consequence for Time:

: If there is no generation and no destruction, then there can be no temporal difference



> Nor was it ever nor will it be, since it is now, all together, one, holding together. ... it is right either fully to be or not.

+ If time 1 differs from a later time 2, then time 1 has gone out of existence and time 2 has come into existence. 
+ The claim that time comes into or out of existence could mean either that temporal moments are entities that come into or go out of existence, or it could mean that the state of the universe as a whole comes into or out of existence. 



## 2. Change 

### Alteration: change in qualities

1. If Socrates learns music, then he has changed from being unmsuical to being musical. 
2. If Socrates learns music, then his unmusicality--unmusical Socrates--goes out of existence and his musicality--musical Socrates--comes into existence.
3. The changes described in 2 involve generation & destruction, which are both impossible.
4. Therefore, Socrates cannot learn music.  

*What is meant to go out of existence:* (i) the property, e.g, being red, warm, etc., (ii) The state that Socrates is someway, e.g., that Socrates is red, that Socrates is warm, etc. (ii) The unusual object that has Socrates and the property as parts, e.g., the-warm-Socrates, the-red-Socrates, etc. 


### Movement: change in location

*Version 1*

1. If Socrates moves to location 2 from location 1, then there is some time when location 2 is empty. 
2. If location 2 is empty, then location 2 is nothing. 
3. Location 2 cannot not be, i.e., location 2 cannot be a non-existent thing. 

*Version 2*

1. If Socrates moves from location 1 to location 2, then Socrates is at location 1 at one time and location 2 at a different time. 
2. Socrates can occoupy different locations only if times exist. 
3. Time does not exist. 
4. Therefore, Socrates cannot move. 




## 3. Completeness ##

1. If Socrates occupies some location, but not all locations, there is some location where he is not
2. ...





### 4.  Plurality

*Version 1*
1. If  x and y are numerically distinct,, then something, a,  must separate x and y. 
2. a cannot be nothing. 
3. Thefore, a is some existing thing. 
4. If a is some existing thing, then something, b, must separate x and z, and something, c, must separate y and z. 
5. b and c cannot be nothing. 
6. Therefore, b and c are some existing things. 
7. ...x and y are not numerically distinct.


*Version 2*

1. If there were two things, say Superman and Batman, it would be true to say that one of them is not the other.
2. ?
3. ?
4. ?


  *Version 3*

  1. If there were two things, say Superman and Batman, there would property, P, such that Superman had P and Batman did not have P
  2. ?






## One Simple Response: not all denials are denials of existence.


+ The statement that Socrates **is musical** should not be analyzed as referring to the musicality of Socrates and saying of it that it exists.
+ Likeweise, the statement that Socrates **is not musical** should not be analyzed as referring to the musicality of Socrates and saying that it does not exist.

**Summary:* Claims that x is not P are not equivalent to denials of existence.





The Poem begins: 

- Maiden daughters of Helios, the sun God. 
- Justice is the God who guards the gates
- Going to Nyx, the Goddess of night, the points where Helios and Nyx cross paths.



Parmenides claims that there are only  two logically coherent possibilities in any inquiry – that the subject of the enquiry exists or it does not exist. He rules out the latter as unlearnable. 

What does this mean? When you begin an inquiry, you must hold an object of thought firmly in your mind and ask questions about it. You might ask things like, does it exist or not? He thinks that you cannot even entertain the possibility that the thing cannot exist and so cannot even try answer the question.

## Thought

- one cannot refer to what is not there to refer to.

- Compare: trying to see something that is not there to be seen. It is impossible. It is true that you might hallucinate a dolphin, but there was a hallucination to see. Imagine if there were both no dolphin and no hallucination. The he would not see anything at all.

- Well, reasons Parmenides (though not, of course, with Hamlet in mind), why should speech or thought be any different? We cannot see what is not there to be seen, so why should we be able to refer to what is not there to be referred to? If something does not exist, in other words, we cannot think about it and we cannot speak about it.

- Because of this profound link between thinking and being, Parmenides claims we cannot make any statements of non-being. So we cannot, for instance, speak about unicorns, even to say that they do not exist. In fact, we can never claim that anything does not exist, because anything that does not exist cannot be spoken about.



## The Way of Truth M


KRS: in fr.2 the Goddess was specifying logically coherent alternatives between which rational enquirers must decide. “The third way is simply the path you will find yourself following if, like the generality of mortals, you do not take that decision through failure to use your critical powers. You will find yourself saying or implying both that a thing is and that it is not (e.g. by acknowledging change and coming into existence); and so you will wander helplessly from one of the ways distinguished in 291 to the other.”p247

(iii) Signs of truth. 
1)	that being and uncreated and imperishable it is
2)	whole of a single kind 
3)	unshaken 
4)	perfect.

The signs constitute formal requirements which any subject of enquiry must satisfy. 

Upshot of Parmenides’ argument is a form of monism: everything there is must have one and the same character; and it is doubtful whether in fact anything could have that character except reality as a whole. 

(iii) (a) Uncreated and imperishable. 
Fr. 8: ‘It never was nor will be, since it is now, all together one, continuous.’
I’m not sure my interpretation will work. I want to say if x is(e) F, then it could not be otherwise. But surely it was(e) F and will(e) be F. Well, wait, Parmenides could be just saying that it is not the case that now [it] which is no longer now, was before now. And likewise with will. So he might not be talking about something that is now and was also before and will be. But what about the qualification.
But he does speak about being completely – funky. 

He asks ‘how could what is be in the future’. He must be assuming that if something is in the future then it should not be now. This is surely absurd on an existential reading. But it makes sense on a Curd readings. The point is that this thing now x (which is F) could not be G in the future. Or maybe, this thing now x is a being now, so how it could it be the case that now it will only have its essence in the future. 

These lines are meant to show that what is cannot come to be or perish. 

(iii) (b) One and continuous. 
KRS thinks that Parmenides intends to show that all reality is one by this thesis. I’m not sure. 

Nor is it divided, since it all exists alike; nor is it more here and less there which would prevent it from holding together, but it is all full of being. So it is all continuous: for what is draws near to what is. 

The reference here looks like the sortal or form. He is claiming it is homogenous. The ‘all full of being’, I think suggests that whatever the subject is has no lack or non-being. 

(iii) (c) Unchangeable. 
So he says that it is not just imperishable and doesn’t come to be but also does not alter. Interesting that he has two notions of change. 

(iii) (d) Perfect.
What is should not be imperfect (think Nehamas)
“The same thing is there to be thought and is why there is thought.”

Mortal Opinions. 
(i)

> 

When you think, you think of something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something. Therefore both thought and language require objects outside themselves. And since you can think of a thing or speak of it at one time as well as another, whatever can be thought of or spoken of must exist at all times. Consequently there can be no change, since change consists in things coming into being or ceasing to be (Russell 1945, 49).
