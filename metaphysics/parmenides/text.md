title: Parmenides' Challenge

---

Parmenides of Elea, current day Italy, was active in the earlier part of the 5th c. BCE. He is part of a school of philosophy called the *Eleatics*. We will learn about his student Zeno later in the course. 


'On Nature', the work we are studying, was written in hexameter verse, a standard meter for poems of this type. Homer's *Odyssey*, for instance, was written in hexameter. We will study the poem in translation, but it is near impossible to recreate this particular Greek meter in English. So, keep in mind two things: 1) the translation of ancient Greek is not easy and  the translation of several passages is contested, 2) Parmenides intended his readers to hear this as a poem. 

Here is what the poem looks like in the original Greek. 


> 1. Ἵπποι, ταί με φέρουσιν, ὅσον τ ̓ ἐπὶ θυμὸς ἱκάνοι 
2.  πέμπον, ἐπεί μ ̓ ἐς ὁδὸν βῆσαν πολύφημον ἄγουσαι     
3. δαίμονος, ἣ κατὰ πάντ ̓ ἄ<ν>τη<ν> φέρει εἰδότα φῶτα·     
4. τῇ φερόμην, τῇ γάρ με πολύφραστοι φέρον ἵπποι    5. ἅρμα τιταίνουσαι, κοῦραι δ ̓ ὁδὸν ἡγεμόνευον.   
6. ἄξων δ ̓ ἐν χνοίῃσιν ἵ<ει> σύριγγος ἀυτὴν  
7. αἰθόμενος, δοιοῖς γὰρ ἐπείγετο δινωτοῖσιν  
8. κύκλοις ἀμφοτέρωθεν, ὅτε σπερχοίατο πέμπειν  
9. ἡλιάδες κοῦραι προλιποῦσαι δώματα νυκτὸς  10. ἐς φάος, ὠσάμεναι κράτων ἄπο χερσὶ καλύπτρας.

Unfortunately, the full poem has not survived. What has survived are various fragments that have been copied and passed on. These fragments allow us a good understand of the poem, which is now standardly taken to have contained three parts. The first part is called the 'proem', a kind of introductory phase in which Parmenides describes a mystical trip to the halls of a Goddess, most likely the Goddess Nyx (night). The Goddess describes to Parmenides three roads of inquiry and argues that only one road will lead to the truth. The second part of the poem argues that the road of truth involves inquiry into 'what is' or 'being'. Two other roads are rejected, inquiry into 'what is not' or 'non-being' and the inquiry into 'what is and is not', the road of mortals. Whatever the correct the interpretation, the Goddess thinks that any judgement that concerns either directly or indirectly non-being is false. The third part of the poem concerns the way humans normally think the universe and everything in it comes into being and passes away. I do not include that below.  

Note that I have divided the text into chunks, added some titles, and notes to help us read it. I also labelled a few of the most important lines for easy reference. Obviously, none of these markings are in the original.  

## The Introductory Phase

> The mares that carry me kept conveying me as far as ever my spirit reached, once they had taken and set me on the goddess’ way of much discourse, which carries through every stage to meet her face to face a man of understanding.   

> On this I was carried, for on this the sagacious mares were carrying me, straining at the chariot and guided by maidens along the way. The axle in the naves kept blazing and uttering the pipe’s loud note, driven onwards at both ends by its two metalled wheels, whenever the daughters of the sun made haste to convey me, having thrust with their hands their kerchiefs from their heads and deserted the abode of night for the light.

> There stand the gates between the journeys of night and day, enclosed at top and bottom by a lintel and threshold of stone, and themselves fitting closely to a great architrave in the aether. 

> The keys, which allow to open first one gate then the other, retributive justice holds; whom the maidens blandished with soft words and persuaded cunningly to thrust the locked bar for them in a moment from the gates, which swung open and made vacant the gulf of the gateway, turning successively in their sockets the bronze-fitted posts fixed to them with pegs and nails. Whereupon the maidens drove the chariot and mares straight on through the gates along the road.

> And the goddess received me warmly, and taking my right hand in hers spoke as follows and addressed me: 

> Welcome, O youth, arriving at our dwelling as consort of immortal charioteers and mares which carry you; no ill fate sent you forth to travel on this way, which is far removed indeed from the step of men, but right and justice. 

> You must be informed of everything, both of the unmoved heart of persuasive reality and of the beliefs of mortals, which comprise no genuine conviction; nevertheless you shall learn these also, how it was necessary that the things that are believed to be should have their being in general acceptance, ranging through all things from end to end.

> It is indifferent to me whence I begin, for to that place I shall come back again.


## The Possible Ways of Enquiry (fragment 2, 1-8)

1. ‘Come now, I will tell you (and do you preserve my story, when you have heard it) 
2. about those ways of enquiry which are alone conceivable. 
3. The one, that a thing is, and that it is not for not being, 
4. is the journey of persuasion, for persuasion attends on reality; 
5. the other, that a thing is not, and that it must needs not be,
6. this I tell you is a path wholly without report, 
7. for you can neither know what is not (for it is impossible) 
8. nor tell of it ...’
+ ‘... for the same thing is for conceiving as is for being.’

## The Way of Falsehood

> It is necessary to assert and conceive that this is Being. For it is for being, but Nothing is not. 

> These things I command you to heed. From this way of enquiry I keep you first of all, but secondly from that on which mortals with no understanding stray two-headed, for perplexity in their own breasts directs their mind astray and they are borne on deaf and blind alike in bewilderment, people without judgement, by whom this has been accepted as both being and not being the same and not the same, and for all of whom their journey turns backwards again.

> Gaze on even absent things with your mind as present and do so steadily. For it will not sever Being from cleaving to Being, as either dispersing or gathering in every direction in every way in regular order. For this principle shall never be vanquished, so as to allow things to be that are not, but do you keep your thought from this way of enquiry.

> And let not habit do violence to you on the empirical way of exercising an unseeing eye and a noisy ear and tongue, but decide by discourse the controversial test enjoined by me. 

## The Way of Truth

> Only one story of the way is still left: that a thing is. On this way there are very many signs: that Being is **ungenerated and imperishable, entire, unique, unmoved and perfect; it never was nor will be, since it is now all together, one, indivisible.** 

[*Argument that Being is ungenerated and impreshable*]

> For what parentage of it will you look for? How and whence grown? I shall not let you say or conceive, ‘from Not-being’, for it cannot be said or conceived that anything is not; and then what necessity in fact could have urged it to begin and spring up later or before from Nothing? Thus it must either be entirely or not be at all. Nor will the strength of conviction ever impel anything to come to be alongside it from Not-being. 

> Therefore justice did not loosen it in her fetters and move it either to come to be or to be perishing but holds it fast, and the decision regarding these things depends on that of the issue, is or is not. 

> Now it has been decided, as was necessary, to leave the one way unconceived and nameless, since it is not a real way, and for the other to be a way and authentic. And how could what becomes have being, how come into being, seeing that, if it came to be, it is not, nor is it, if at some time it is going to be? 

> Thus becoming has been extinguished and perishing is unheard of.

[*Argument that Being is indivisible*] 

> Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike and not any more in degree in some respect, which might keep it from uniting, or any inferior, but it is all full of Being. Therefore it is all united, for Being draws near to Being.

[*Argument that Being is unchanging*]

> Further, it is changeless in the coils of huge bonds, without beginning or cessation, since becoming and perishing have strayed very far away, thrust back by authentic conviction; remaining the same and in the same state, it lies by itself and remains thus where it is perpetually, for strong necessity holds it in the bondage of a limit, which keeps it apart, because it is not lawful that Being should be incomplete, for it is not defective, whereas Not-being would lack everything.

> The same thing is for conceiving as is cause of the thought conceived; for not without Being, when predications have been asserted of it, will you find the cause so as to conceive of it.

[*Argument that Being has no past or future*]

> And time is not nor will be another thing alongside Being, since this was bound fast by fate to be entire and changeless. Therefore all those things will be a name, which mortals, confident that they are real, suppose to be coming to be and perishing, to be and not to be, and to change their place and alter their bright aspect to dark and from dark to bright.

[*Argument that Being is complete*]

> Since now its limit is ultimate, Being is in a state of perfection from every viewpoint, like the volume of a spherical ball, and equally poised in every direction from its centre. For it must not be either at all greater or at all smaller in one regard than in another. For neither has Not-being any being which could halt the coming together of Being, nor is Being capable of being more than Being in one regard and less in another, since it is all inviolate. For it is equal with itself from every view and encounters determination all alike.
