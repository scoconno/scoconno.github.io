### Introduction
That Parmenides! He is so sincere and always follows an argument wherever it takes him.  But, what a mistake. He has convinced himself that the world as we perceive it is all an illusion. Reality, he has come to be believe, comprises one and only one thing. There are no plurality of cats, or dogs, or people, or anything! Moreover, he thinks this one thing is uncreated and indestructible; it will exist for eternity. He thinks it cannot alter, grow, or move, and he insists that it occupies all of space. What are you going to do with him, your oldest and dearest friend? 

Fortunately, Parmenides is a reasonable person and would gladly learn of any mistakes in his argument. You decide to write him a letter diagnosing the error in his reasoning. 

### Task

Write a letter to Parmenides. The letter must do the following:

+ Explain what you take to be the principle claim driving the argument and why Parmenides seems to accept it. 
+ Explain why this principle is wrong and explain how rejecting it blocks the conclusions of Parmenides' arguments. 

**NB:** You are writing a letter to a dear old friend. This essay should be written and formatted, then, as a letter.  Use ordinary language. Embellish the letter with short, friendly details, e.g., 'you are just trying to get out of that tennis game with this denial of motion!' 

### Word Count

500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.

### Due Date

Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.

### Format

Submit your work by first clicking on the relevant assignment in Blackboard. Click on ‘browse computer’ and upload your document as a .doc, .rtf, or .pdf file. Please use ‘attach document’. Do not send it to me by e-mail or through Blackboard’s messaging application.
