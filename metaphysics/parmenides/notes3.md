# Aristotle's Response to Parmenides


For an introduction to Aristotle and his life, see [here](\metaphysics\parmenides\overview). 


Consider again this table that summarizes the various ways Parmenides' predecessors differed from him. 


|	| Parmenides  | Empedocles  | The Atomists  | Aristotle |
| :----------: |:-----------:| :-----:| :--------: |:-------:|
| Gen. & Dest. | No  | No 	|  No	| Yes |
| Motion     | No     |   Yes | Yes |  Yes |
| Alteration | No      |   Yes |	No |	Yes |
| Plurality  | No      |   Yes | Yes |  Yes |
| Empty space | No     |   No	| Yes | No |

Unlike Empedocles, Aristotle was not willing to deny even the existence of generation and destruction; he thought it more likely that Parmenides had erred than that our beliefs in such change were false. But he respected Parmenides, and he thought responding appropriately required properly characterizing the most basic structure of change and clearly applying that structure to generation and destruction. We will focus on his account of change first. 

**Claim 1: all change occurs between opposites** 

> White comes from not-white, and not from any not-white, but from black or some intermediate. Similarly, musical comes to be from non-musical, but not from any thing other than musical, but from unmusical or any intermediate state there may be. [188b1]

> Nor again do things pass away into the first chance thing; white does not pass into musical (except, it may be, accidentally), but into not-white—and not into any chance thing which is not white, but into black or an intermediate; musical passes into not-musical–and not into any chance thing other than musical, but into unmusical or any intermediate state there may be. [188b4]

> If then this is true, everything that comes to be or passes away comes from, or passes into, its contrary or an intermediate state. [188b21]

These passages indicate that there are three ways to describe any change:

+ A: The man become musical...the man, the subject, remains
+ B: Not-musical becomes musical...G, the privation does not remain
+ C: The not-musical man becomes a musical man...X, the subject part of the compound remains. The compound, however, does not remain

Despite appearances, Aristotle thinks that A, B, and C really only describe one thing: a case where a man goes from being unmusical to musical. But the most important upshot for us will concern non-existence. 


Distinguish two claims: 

1. Socrates becomes healthy from being not-healthy. 
2. Socrates becomes healthy from being sick. 

Our first claim may appear to speak about what does not exist, i.e., about the non-existence of health. But, the second claim speaks of some existing thing, i.e., it speaks about the existing sickness that Socrates possessed. Aristotle wants to emphasize that change can be described in ways that avoid speaking about what strictly does not exist. 

**Claim 2: there is a subject of change distinct from those opposites the change occurs between**

> Granted then, that they [the principles of nature] are a limited number, it is plausible to assume them more than two. For it is difficult to see how either density should be of such a nature to make rarity something or rarity is such to make density something. The same is true of any other pair of opposites; for Love does not gather Strife together and make things out of it, nor does Strife make anything out of Love, but both make a third thing something. Some indeed assume more than one such thing from which they construct the nature of beings (189a21–27).

Aristotle claims here that the entity that changes is distinct from the opposites the change occurs between. When the unmusical becomes musical, the unmusicality is different from the student who has yet to learn music; they student, being musical, and being unmusical are distinct entities. 

Changes are changes of place (locomotion), of degree (growth), of
quality (alteration), or of substance (generation). These are collectively called qualified changes. In qualified changes, it is easy to identify an enduring subject and those opposites they occur between. 




## Generation & Destruction: Hylomorphism

The problem, though, is how to apply this model to generation and destruction: what is the subject and the pair of opposites involved in generation and destruction? Aristotle's answer has two parts. First, he emphasizes that there is a difference between substances and their predicates, and he claims that, strictly, it is only substances that are generated and destroyed. Second, he argues that the opposites and subject involved in substantial change are a special trio of entities: matter, form, and privation. 

#### Short Tangent on Substance

According to Aristotle, the only entities that truly are generated and destroyed are substances. Other entities, like colors, shapes, etc., are never generated or destroyed. So, what are substances. 

Aristotle posits a fundamental metaphysical distinction between
substantial entities and non-substantial entities (qualities,
quantities, etc.). Substance translates the Greek word, 'hupokeimenon', which means roughly 'what underlies'. It is used to describe that which possesses qualities, quantities, relations, and activities, but it is not itself possessed by anything else. We will say that qualities, quantities, relations, and activities inhere in substances, where P inheres in S if S somehow possesses or has P, e.g., the color purple inheres in my water bottle because the bottle has that color, my sitting inheres in me because I am doing that sitting, etc.

Substances are obviously different from what inheres in them. The weight of a stone is different from the stone itself. The motion of a molecule is different from the molecule itself. Motion and weight belong to these substances, but they are not themselves substances. In contrast, the molecule and the stone are substances because they are subjects in which other things inhere but do not themselves inhere in anything else, e.g., the stone is not a property of anything else, but other things are properties of it.

This contrast between substances and what inheres in them obviously resembles a linguistic contrast between grammatical subjects and predicates, between 'Flipper' and 'swimming' in the sentence 'Flipper is swimming'. But the contrast is more fundamental than the linguistic one. The word 'swimming' could also serve as a grammatical subject, e.g., 'swimming is a pleasant activity'. The word 'Flipper' could also serve as a predicate, e.g., 'the toy belongs to Flipper'. But substances can never inhere in anything else; they can never be possessed by anything else. They are the fundamental bedrock for everything that inheres in them.

The criteria for something's being a substance is as follows: 


Substance: 
: X is a substance if and only if (i) X is not predicated of anything else, and (ii) other things are predicated of X. 

Predicate:
: Y is a predicate if and only if there is some, Z, such that Y is predicated of Z.

## Matter, form, and privation


The subjects and opposites involved in alterations, growth, and locomotion are easy enough believes Aristotle. The subject is always a substance and never a predicate. The opposites are always predicates and never substances. But what is the subject and opposites involved in the generation and destruction of substances? Aristotle's second important claim in his analysis of generation & destruction begins as follows: 

> For in every case there is something that is a subject from which the thing that comes into being [comes into being], as plants and animals come into being from sperma. Some of the things that come into being without qualification [i.e., substances] do so by change of figure (for instance, a statue); some by addition (for instance, growing things); some by subtraction (for instance, Hermes from the stone); some by composition (for instance, a house); some by alteration (for instance, by being turned [into something else] in accordance with matter). It is evident that everything that comes to be in this way comes to be from a subject (190b3–10).

Aristotle here emphasizes that there really are subjects from which substances are generated. Statues, for instances, are created from stone. Aristotle goes on to call the various subjects that substances are generated from **matter** and the opposite that is gained in the change 'form' (or 'shape). So, when Socrates is generated, some matter gains some form. The reason this differs from mere alterations is that Socrates has not changed in one of his features. Rather, by matter taking on a new form, there is a now a new object that has the form and the matter as parts. 

> Suppose, then, that there are indeed causes and principles of natural beings, from which they primarily are and have come to be – not come to be coincidentally, but come to be what each thing is called in accordance with its essence. It evidently follows that everything comes to be from the subject and the shape. For in a way the musical man is composed from man and musical, since you will analyze him into their accounts. It is clear, then, that whatever comes to be does so from these things (190b17–23).10


### Matter and Form

In general, Aristotle accepts a version of *hylomporhpism*, a metaphysical view on which (almost) all existing things are composites of matter and form.

*Matter*
> "That from which, as present in it, a thing comes to be". 

Generally, he calls the matter the underlying material. The bronze and silver are material causes of the statue and the bowl. So too are letters of syllables, matter of artifacts, fire and such things of bodies, parts of wholes, and premises of a conclusion.

*Form*

> "The form (i.e. the pattern)\... The form is the account (and the genera of the account) of the essence, and parts in that account".   

The form is roughly what you refer to in explaining what something is. It is a set of capacities that jointly constitute what it is to be something of a certain kind, e.g., the capacities that jointly constitute being a human being.




## Aristotle's response to Parmenides

Aristotle presents Parmenides' puzzle as follows:

> The first of those who studied philosophy were misled in their search for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were thrust them into another path. So they say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible. For what is cannot come to be (because it is already), and from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must be underlying). [191a25]

He responds by making a point similar to Empedocles: to say that something comes 'from what is' is ambiguous. Similarly, to say that something comes 'from what is not' is ambiguous. Aristotle will agree that some readings are problematic, but he insists that others are not. Focusing on 'what is' first and using Socrates as an example. It could mean: 

1. Socrates comes from what is already Socrates. 
2. Socrates comes from what exists. 
3. Socrates comes from something that has some feature or other. 

Aristotle agrees with Parmenides that 1 is impossible. But he thinks that 2 and 3 are perfectly possible. This is the route that many of those after Parmenides also took. The real novelty comes with his account of 'what is not'. The claim that Socrates comes from 'what is not' could mean: 

1. Socrates comes from what is not (already) Socrates.
2. Socrates comes from what does not exist. 

Aristotle agrees with 2. He accepts that Socrates cannot come from what does not exist (such a thing would be nothing at all). But, Aristotle thinks 1 is perfectly possible. Socrates comes from some matter that is not yet Socrates, but can still be turned into Socrates (when the relevant form is imposed on Socrates). Likewise, a house comes from a pile of bricks that are not yet a house, but a pile that can be turned into a house (when they are arranged--informed--in the right way). Aristotle's point is that claims of type 1 do not require us to think and speak about non-existing entities. It requires that we speak and think about matter that does not yet have some relevant form. But when we do this, we are thinking and speaking about some existing thing.
