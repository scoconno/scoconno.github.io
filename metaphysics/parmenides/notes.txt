Here's the periodic table. The atomic number or nuclear charge number (symbol Z) of a chemical element is the charge number of an atomic nucleus. For ordinary nuclei, this is equal to the proton number (np) or the number of protons found in the nucleus for every atom of that element.

If race exists, what are they?

If you believe they exist, you might think they are natural categories and to be a member of a race is to have a set of natural properties that they share with other members of that races. 

Natural properties are properties that exist independently of the mind. 

What are these natural properties? Perhaps biological ones? We would study it in the sciences. 



Socio-historical properties. 
W.E.B Dubois 1915

"While races transcend scientific definition, they nevertheless are clearly defined to the eye of the historian and the sociologist." 

Doctors are identifiable. They work in hospitals. Talk in ways that suggest they have knowledge. They go to school. Get medical license. 'Having a degree' is a property explained by socio-historical facts. Study it from sociology and history. 

Racial properties belong to the history.

 **Darwin**
 We all descendend from the same ancestor. Surely, if race was biological, the relevant features must be selected for. But he saw now way they could be.
