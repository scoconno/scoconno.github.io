\section{Introduction}

Things must be a certain way for us to have any experiences of them. For instance, things must have color and shape for us to see them, they must be spatially separated from us and other things if we are distinguish them from one another and from ourselves, etc. Let us call the features and relations that things must have for us to perceive them \emph{phenomenal properties}. Metaphysicians have been interested in the following question: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Do we experience things  \emph{because} they have phenomenal properties, or do things have phenomenal properties \emph{because} we experience them?
\item Compare: Is piety good \emph{because} God loves it, or does God love piety \emph{because} it is good? 
\end{itemize} 
We shall call \emph{phenomenalists} those who believe that things have phenomenal properties because we experience them.  It is a view that Aristotle attributes to Protagoras: 
\begin{quote}
...all things believed [ta dokounta panta] and [all] appearances [ta phainomena] are true’ (1009a8).
\end{quote}
`The things that appear to us' (ta phainomena) are things as they appear to our senses, i.e. the contents of our sense perceptions. The `things that we believe’ (ta dokounta) are general things as we believe them to be, i.e. the contents of our beliefs in general. We can believe things that we do not sense and \emph{vice versa} 

\begin{description}
\item[Phenomenalism (PHEN):] Anything that appears thus and so to someone, and anything that someone believes to be thus and so, is thus and so (i.e. all appearances and all beliefs are true).
\end{description}


Distinguish the following two claims:


\begin{enumerate}
\item For \emph{some} property F, an object O is F because O appears F to someone. 
\item For \emph{any} property F,  an object O is F because O appears F to someone. 
\end{enumerate}
The first claims says that objects have just some properties because of how they appear to us. The second claims that any property an object has is explained by how it appears to us. PHEN makes the second claim. The schematic argument for PHEN:
\begin{itemize}
\item P1. No object has an essence.  
\item P2. If no object has an essence, then we cannot speak and think about things. 
\item P3. But we can speak and think about things. 
\item P4. We can speak and think about things if they have an essence because of how appear to us (even if they have no essence independently of how they appear to us.) 
\item C. Therefore, things have an essence because of how they appear to us.  
\end{itemize}

\section{P1. Essence}

The word `essence'  is from the Latin word `essentia', which was coined to translate a phrase invented by Aristotle, `to ti en einai.' This roughly translates as `what it was for something to be'. He introduced it to describe the stable natures that changing being have over time. The phrase was then extended to discuss the natures of non-changing beings. For our purposes, we will define \emph{essentialism} as the conjunction of the following two claims:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each changing thing belongs to some kind K such that if that thing ceases to be a K, it will cease to exist...e.g., Socrates dies if he ceases to be human, Flipper dies if he ceases to be a dolphin. 
\item For every kind K there are a unique set of individually necessary conditions that are jointly sufficient for membership of that kind, e.g., being rational and being an animal are each necessary conditions for being human. They are also jointly sufficient for being a human; anything that satisfies both is a human and nothing is a human that does not satisfy both. 
\end{itemize}
Some standard objections to essentialism: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is possible for objects to change kinds without ceasing to exist, e.g., Lots wife, some fish, werewolves, etc.
\item There are no necessary and sufficient conditions for kind membership, e.g., species evolve, amputees are still members of their kind, etc.
\item Belief is essentialism leads to prejudices. 
\item Things change always and in every way, and nothing is constant about them.
\end{enumerate}

\section{P2. Essence and thought}

Recall that P2 says the following: 

\item P2. If no object has an essence, then we cannot speak and think about things. 

\begin{quote}
For not to signify one thing [a unitary thing, a determinate thing] amounts to not signifying anything at all.
\end{quote}

when we think and speak about something (e.g. Socrates, which is Aristotle’s example, see 1007b5f.), we think and speak about it as opposed to anything else. . But to indicate this is, exactly, to indicate how the thing that we are thinking and speaking about is the determinate thing that it is.


\begin{itemize}
\item To think and speak about something is to think and speak about one thing as opposed to another, e.g., to think and speak about Socrates is to think and speak about Socrates as opposed to something else. 
\item  In order to think and speak about one thing as opposed to another, we must be able to indicate what distinguishes the thing that we are thinking and speaking about from other things, e.g., to think and speak about a cloud we must be able to indicate what distinguishes the cloud from other things.  
\item In order to distinguish the thing that we are thinking and speaking about from other things, we must either indicate one of its accidents or its essence. 
\item We can only distinguish one thing from another by indicating one of its accidents if that thing also has an essence.   
\begin{itemize}
\item If A is an accident, then A is predicated of some subject S. 
\item If A is predicated of S, then S must be a determinate subject, e.g., friendliness is predicated of some individual person. 
\item If S is determinate, then S  
\end{itemize}

For example, to think that clouds are something determinate is to think that a cloud, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, namely, a cloud, is condensed vaporous water, as opposed to something else. Or, in Aristotle’s example, to think that a human being is something determinate is to think that a human being, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, namely, a human being, is a two-footed animal, as opposed to something else (see 1006a31–34 and b13– 14; we may note that the content of the particular example does not appear to matter to him, for he hardly thinks that this, a two-footed animal, is what a human being essentially is). 

To think and speak of something is to think and speak of something as having an essence (see 1006b32–34); for in general when he says that the essence (to ti ēn einai) of a thing, x, is F, he means that the thing, x, is, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, F.
