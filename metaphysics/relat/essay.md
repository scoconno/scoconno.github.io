### Introduction

These idiots! You, Protagoras, are famous throughout Greece. Your fame is well deserved. You have solved so many philosophical problems. Most importantly, you have proved something fundamental about the nature of reality: everything is what it is because of how it appears to us. 

But, you are so misunderstood! People have ridiculed you. They have dismissed you. Some even called you a vegetable. They just aren't listening carefully enough. You need to set the record straight. You will make a written declaration in your defense. You will then have it copied and posted publicly in the market place of every large town and village. 

### Task
Pretend to be Protagoras and write the public declaration. That declaration must do the following: 

1. Clearly articulate your view that everything is what it is because of how it appears to us. Use some very simple examples in your articulation.
2. Identify one key objection to your view. 
3. Respond to that objection. 



### Word Count

500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.

### Due Date

Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.

### Format

Submit your work by first clicking on the relevant assignment in Blackboard. Click on ‘browse computer’ and upload your document as a .doc, .rtf, or .pdf file. Please use ‘attach document’. Do not send it to me by e-mail or through Blackboard’s messaging application.
