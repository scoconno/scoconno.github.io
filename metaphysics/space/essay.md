## Introduction

Why does the existence of higher spatial dimensions pose a threat to Internalism with respect to incongruent counterparts? 

## Task

Assume that higher spatial dimensions exist. Your essay should do the following: 

1. Explain the notion of 'incongruent counterparts.' Use something other than hands as an example.
1. Explain Internalism with respect to Incongruent Counterparts. 
2. Explain the notion of a higher spatial dimension, e.g., explain the notion of a fourth spatial dimension.  
2. Explain how the existence of higher spatial dimensions poses a threat to Internalism.
 

## Further Instruction
+ Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. You will need to explain the terminology you introduce. Try also to find ways of explaining what a fourth dimension might be. 
+ This essay has 2 major learning goals: 
	1. Teach you the difference between explaining a view and arguing for a view. So, in the first part of your paper, you should neutrally explain Internalism as clearly as you can while avoiding arguing for or against it. 
	2. Teach you to explain and argue for views that you might not accept.  In the first part of your essay, you should explain Internalism as clearly and charitably as you can (as if it was the view you accepted). In the second part, you will use the possibility of higher dimensions to argue against Internalism as forcibly as you can (regardless of whether you think there are higher dimensions or if you think that Internalism is true or not.)

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
