`Flatland' is a short novel by Edwin A. Abbott that was first published in 1884. I want to alert you to the author's poor portrayal of women, which he was criticized for even when the novel was first published. Despite this serious flaw, the novel raises two key questions for us: what would a 2-dimensional universe be like? Could we imagine a 4-dimensional universe?

The sections are short. The most important are sections, 1,3,5,6,13--20. Read these sections carefully, but feel free to skim the rest of the novel. The book is available in three formats:
