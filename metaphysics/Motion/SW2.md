Assume that space is discrete. This essay has two parts. 

1. Explain the Stadium Paradox  
2. Try solve the paradox while maintaining the assumption that space is discrete.
 

## Further Instruction

+ Use diagrams, illustrations, etc., to explain the paradox. 
+ We didn't discuss possible solutions in class. This was by design. The second part of this exercise is asking you to think for yourself. It's ok if your solution ultimately won't work. I want you to try!
+ Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. Explain the terminology you introduce.
