## Introduction

You have written several short essays so far. For this assignment, you will pick one of the questions below and write a longer, standard research paper for it. The paper must be appropriately structured, have a clear thesis statement, include citations and a bibliography, and generally conform to the standard norms of an intermediate college level course. 

You will be assessed on how you use the reading that was assigned for the topic. I discourage you from using any other source. You will be especially penalized if you use Reddit, wikipedia, quora, blogs, google searches. etc.--I use software to check papers for such use. 


**Important details:**

+ Word count: 1000--1250 words. Note that your word count does not include the bibliography, headers, or citations. It includes only the body of your paper. 
+ Citation style: use MLA, Chicago, or APA. It's up to you, but be consistent throughout.

## Pick ONE

**Prompt 1:** Parmenides claims that there is no coming-to-be either (a) from “what is not” or (b) from “what is.”  Aristotle replies that in one sense both of these claims are correct, but in another sense they are both incorrect. First, explain what Aristotle means by this with reference to his account of change and coming-into-being in Physics I. In doing so, make sure to explicitly discuss Parmenides' argument, i.e., tell me which premise or premises Aristotle rejects. Second, assess Aristotle's response to Parmenides

**Prompt 2:** 1) Explain as clearly as you can how Alexander's dictum is used to reject eliminativism in respect of race and subsequently used to support constructivism in respect of race. Make sure to clearly explain both these positions. 2) Explain how an eliminativist might offer a different analysis of the examples used by those appealing to Alexander's Dictum to argue for the reality of race.

**Prompt 3:** 1) As charitably and clearly as you can, present a reconstruction of Zeno’s arrow paradox. 2) Explain how the at-at theory of motion purports to solve this paradox? 3) Assess this solution, i.e., explain whether it adequately addresses the paradox and also whether it has any internal difficulties?
