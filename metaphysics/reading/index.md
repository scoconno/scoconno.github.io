title: Slaughterhouse Five

---


I attach here a link to Kurt Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse Five.* We're interested in the two understandings of time we encounter in the novel, one by the Tralfamadorians, the other by humans. Ignore ch.1. The story begins with ch.2. Read at least ch.2,3,4 & 5, paying special attention to ch.5. I include two formats. The first is the easiest to read, but you will need an ePub reader to open it. Use iBooks or something similar. The second is a pdf generated from the book. It's readable, but the chapter marks are harder to discern. Use the epub if possible.
