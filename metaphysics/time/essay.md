## Introduction

Tough gig. You have been a tour guide for many years, but this new tour is harder than anything you have tried before. It was only last year when Tralfamadorians and humans became aware of one another. Already, there are tourist trips to each planet. Your job is to lead inter-planatery tours. You normally prep visitors about the cultures they will visit, alert them to variation in ethical norms and educate them about practical considerations. But this new tour will require you to something even harder: you must explain the very different ways each species experiences time and just how that might affect the tourists' trip. You better prepare a detailed tour script introducing Tralfamadorians to Earth and Humans to Tralfamadore.


## Task
Write the tour script, the introduction you will use to explain the respective ways each species understands and experiences time. The script must do the following: 

1. Explain to the human visitors how the Tralfamadorians understand and experience time. Use analagoies and metaphors. Explain how this difference might manifest itself on Tralfamadore, e.g., how will humans need to adjust their views about schedules, clocks, meetimg times, etc. 

2. Explain to the Tralfmadorians how humans understand and experience time. Use analagoies and metaphors. Explain how this difference might manifest itself on Earth, e.g., how will Tralfamadorians need to adjust their views to successfully visit Earth.
