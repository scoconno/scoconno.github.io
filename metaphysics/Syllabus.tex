\section{Course Description and Objectives}

Most of us believe that change exists, that babies are born, that trees grow, and that planes fly in the sky. However, the existence of change has long been doubted. Some deny that any kind of change exists. Other deny that certain kinds of change like motion exist. These denials seem radical. Surely babies are born, trees do grow, and planes really do fly in the sky. Nevertheless, the arguments that change does not exist are powerful and our goal will be to understand and assess them. 


\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) read
philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv)
write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and
persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of several core
metaphysical issues.

\section{Readings}

All readings will be posted on the course website. You do not need to purchase anything for this course. 


\section{Course Website}
There is both a Blackboard site and website for this course (link on first page). Clicking the first link on the left panel within the Blackboard site will bring you to the course website. All assignments will be submitted through Blackboard. Readings, notes, etc. will be posted on the course website. Note that Blackboard difficulties are rare and automatically reported to instructors.
