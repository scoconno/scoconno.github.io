\section{Course Description}

This course introduces students to the political, social, and cultural developments of Ancient Greece by examining the work of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Pre-Socratics. By connecting historical events with the development of philosophy, students will learn how philosophy shaped the trajectory of Greek civilization. Topics include the Athenian democracy, the Peloponnesian War, the rise of Macedon, and the Hellenistic period, all contextualized within philosophical debates about morality, justice, happiness, and the nature of reality.  No prior knowledge of philosophy or ancient history is required.

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course students will be able to (i) read philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv) write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of the philosophies of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and select periods in the the History of Ancient Greece. .
