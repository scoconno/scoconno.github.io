\section{Copyright}
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Course Description}

What do you know? Do you know anything? What exists? Are there objective truths about whatâ€™s right and wrong for you to do, or is it all a matter of convention? Does being a moral person go against your self-interest? If so, why should you be a moral person? What is happiness? Will being a moral person contribute to your happiness? These questions were raised by philosophers speaking and writing in Greek over two millennia ago. In this course, we will think hard about these questions and try to identify how they were answered by three of the most influential philosophers of all time---Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. 

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course students will be able to (i) read philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv) write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of the philosophies of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

\section{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

\item \sout {\textit{Experiential learning:} this course contains a mandatory study abroad trip to Greece. In order to pass the course, you must participate in this trip and complete the associated assignments. Those unable to travel must have received an exemption from either the Honors Director or Mr. Craig Kratz prior to the start of the course. Exempted students must visit assigned sites in the New York metro area during spring break and complete a series of associated assignments}.

\item \textbf{Experiential learning:} this course intends to provide context to the philosophical material through experiential activities. While those activities initially involved either trips to Greece or NYC, the coronavirus has made the former impossible.  Students may still pursue the NYC activities in April and/or May. Those who wish to opt out altogether from experiential learning due to the coronavirus can complete four essays, one each on Greek history, Greek art, Greek rites and games, and Athenian daily life. Topics will be announced in-person.\footnote{Updated March, 5th, 2020 due to Covid-19}

\item \textit{Workload:} expect to spend an average of 6 hours per week completing the readings and assignments. NJCU abides by the Federal and State definitions of a credit hour and adopts a policy consistent with the Carnegie Unit. A three-credit class represents 112.5 hours total of work. See \href{http://scottoconnor.org/resources/Credit.pdf}{here} for more details.

\item \textit{Participation:} 0.5 point will be awarded per class up to a maximum of 8 points. Points will not be awarded during weeks 1 \& 2. Participation points will be awarded if you attend, stay alert, stay for the duration of the class, leave your electronic devices turned off and out of sight, are cordial and non-disruptive, try to contribute to our discussions. 


\item \textit{Gobbets (250--500 words)} submitted through Blackboard. The first is due at the beginning of week 3. 10 will be assigned. Maximum points will be awarded on the first two gobbets as long as they are attempted. You will complete these questions before we discuss the texts in class. This is by design. 

\item \sout{\textit{Experiential learning related assignments:} short reflective on-site assignments (20 points total), or four non-experiential learning related essays (5 points each).}

\item \textit{Individual research project:} The course project will include a proposed question and exploratory paper (10 points), first draft (10 points), presentation (10 points), and final paper (20 points). 

\item \textit{Course evaluations} completed online. 3 points extra credit for successful completion.

\item \textit{Grade Distribution:} Participation--0.5 point per class (10 total); Gobbets--4 points each (40 total); \sout{experiential related--20 total;} research project 50 total.

\item \textit{Covid curve:} The total points a student earns through there completed assignments and participation will be increased by 10\% in recognition of the disruption brought by Covid. For instance, a student who earns 80 points through their completed assignments and participations will earn a final grade of 88. 

\item \textit{Grade Breakdown:}

 \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{2cm} | l | l | }
    \hline 
96--100 & A  & &  77--79 &  C+ \\  
90--95 & A- & &  73--76 & C \\
87-89 & B+ &  &  70--72 & C- \\
