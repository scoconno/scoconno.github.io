There are three passages this week. They are from *Meno*. Please complete **all three** and submit through the relevant link on Blackboard. For each, write a separate paragraph for *context*, *content*, and *assessment*. So, you will submit a total of 9 paragraphs, 3 paragraphs per passage. Please note that these are not essays. Keep the **total** word count to 500 words, i.e., about 170 words per passage. That's not a lot of words, so you'll need to carefully edit your work to ensure you can say what you want to say. Concision, concision, concision! 

**Passage 1**
And so with size and strength? If a woman is strong, that strength will be the same and have the same form, for by "the same" I mean that strength is no different as far as being strength, whether in a man or a woman. Or do you think there is a difference? (72e)

**Passage 2**
I know what you want to say, Meno. Do you realize what a debater's argument you are bringing up, that a man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know? He cannot search for what he knows-since he knows it, there is no need to search-nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for (80e).

**Passage 3**
So the man who does not know has within himself true opinions about the things that he does not know (85c).
