#### Prompt ####

In *Republic* Book 2, Glaucon tries to argue for a particular claim by, in part, recounting a story about Gyges and a ring. First identify the claim that Glaucon is trying to argue for. Second, extract from Glaucon's story the general premises his argument relies on. 

Note that I'm not asking you to recount the details of the story. I'm asking you to identify the general assumptions the argument relies upon. 

(Re-write that argument in your own words.)
