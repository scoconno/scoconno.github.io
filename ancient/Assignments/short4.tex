\subsection{Prompt}\label{prompt}

You are a writer for a small publishing company. Your company
specializes in educational material, particularly in short works aimed
to explain difficult material to middle school children. You have
received a difficult task today.`Nicomachean Ethics' Book I has ended up
on your desk. Your editor asks you to write a short piece on ch.6, on
the choice of lives, for 21st century children. What a task! You will
need to translate that difficult technical material into simple, English
prose. And you have to do it in a way that youngsters will be able to
read and understand it. A tough job. But you are up to the task! You
will write biographies of three people pursuing these distinct lives to
explain these three conceptions of happiness.
