## Long Essay 1



### Prompt 

In the *Phaedo*, Socrates makes the following claim: 

> “the one aim of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for dying and death” (64a3-4)

In this paper, you will be examining Socrates' views on death. The paper has two parts: 

1. Why does Socrates believe that practicing philosophy is practicing for death? In answering this question, you must identify Socrates' views on the entities that philosophers must study and why he thinks that dying is conducive to that study. Do you think that Socrates is right that we cannot study these entities in this life? Why? Why not? 

2. Socrate offers three arguments for our immortality from 69e-84b. (Ignore the fourth argument that comes later in the dialog.) Pick **one** of these arguments and explain it in detail. What is the weakest premise of this argument? Why? How might Socrates respond?
