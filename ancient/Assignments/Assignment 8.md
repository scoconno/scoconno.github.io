#### Reading #####

We will be discussing  'Physics' Book II ch.3 on Tues. and ch.8-9 on Thur. Frank will present on ch.3. Nick presents on ch.8 (we will discuss ch.9 together). Neither Frank or Nick should do the written assignment for next week, but both must rehearse their presentation with me in advance. 

#### Written Assignment ####

In *Phys.* II. Ch. 3, Aristotle distinguishes 4 different causes. In this assignment, I want you to think like Aristotle and explain the functioning of a) some chosen body part (it's up to you which part you choose), and b) the growth of an oak tree from a sapling into an adult. In each case, suggest candidates for the four causes and explain how these causes differ from one another.
