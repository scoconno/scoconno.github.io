There are two passages this week. They are from *Crito*. Please complete **both** and submit through the relevant link on Blackboard. Since there are two, and not three like last week, your analysis of the passages should be longer, i.e., a total of 500 words for both passages. 

**Passage 1**

Besides, Socrates, I think that what you’re doing isn’t just: throwing away your life, when you could save it, and hastening the very sort of fate for yourself that your enemies would hasten—and indeed have hastened—in their wish to destroy you. What’s more I think you’re also betraying those sons of yours by going away and deserting them when you could bring them up and educate them. So far as you’re concerned, they must take their chances in life; and the chance they’ll get, in all likelihood, is just the one that orphans usually get when they lose their parents. No. Either one shouldn’t have children at all, or one ought to see their upbringing and education through to the end. But you seem to me to be choosing the easiest way out, whereas one should choose whatever a good and brave man would choose—particularly when one claims to have cared about virtue throughout one’s life (45c-d).


**Passage 2**

“Well then,” they might say, “surely you’re breaking the commitments and agreements you made with us. You weren’t coerced or tricked into agreeing or forced to decide in a hurry. On the contrary, you had seventy years in which you could have left if you weren’t satisfied with us or if you thought those agreements unjust. You, however, preferred neither Sparta nor Crete—places you often say have good law and order—nor any other Greek or foreign city. On the contrary, you went abroad less often than the lame, the blind, or other handicapped people. Hence it’s clear that you, more than any other Athenian, have been consistently satisfied with your city and with us Laws—for who would be satisfied by a city but not by its laws? Won’t you, then, stand by your agreements now? Yes, you will, if you’re persuaded by us, Socrates, and at least you won’t make yourself a laughingstock by leaving the city (52d-53a).
