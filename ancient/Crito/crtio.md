***Review from Apology (Euthyprho?)***

1.  The charge

2.  The judgment

3.  Maybe civil disobedience stuff from there

4.  something about virtue here?

***Introduction***

***Civil Disobedience: Discuss***

1.  Rosa Parks

2.  Edward Snowden

3.  Maybe tax avoidance

4.  Were these illegal acts morally permissible? If not, why not? If
    some were, but others weren't, what's the salient difference?

***Socrates' Argument: Introduced***

1.  Social Contract.

***Elements of a Contract***

1.  Basically, benefit, obligation, penalty, and assent.

2.  Analogy with course policies. 1) Set of benefits. 2) Set of
    obligations. 3) Penalty 3) Tacit assent ( they could have left)

***Return to Socrates Argument to identify these three distinct
elements. ***

1.  Benefits:

2.  Obligations: Obey or persuade them otherwise.

3.  Penalty:

4.  Assent: he could have gone elsewhere

***Return to the four examples above. What would Socrates say about
these cases? Can they think of problematic cases? ***

*Goal is to make sure they understand the view. Gives them a way of
thinking with and beyond the material. *

***Exegetical Puzzle***

1.  Socrates in Apology offers says that he did not obey the Thirty
    Commanders. He will also never stop philosophizing. I want to make
    this look really inconsistent. I won't examine alternative ways of
    responding to it.

2.  This is an apparent inconsistency. Ask students to look in text for
    find ways of alleviating the puzzle.

3.  If/when a student identifies a way of alleviating the inconsistency
    that has been explored in the text, point it out and develop the
    view further for her/him. Direct them to that literature.
