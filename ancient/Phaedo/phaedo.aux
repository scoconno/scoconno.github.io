The worry was that we could only find a satisfying definition of F (and hence have knowledge of F things) if there are stable Forms. Question: what kind of change are we talking about here? 1. Succession of Opposites (SO): Typically, when we think of change we think of SO. To say that something undergoes SO is to say that it is F at t1, but becomes not F at some later time t2; in other words, cases of SO are cases where one and the same thing has opposite properties or characteristics at different times. Example: I was fat in January (t1), but I went on a diet and by June (t2) I was no longer fat but rather thin. 2. Compresence of Opposites (CO): Use ``change'' in a broad sense. One thing has properties F and not F, but at the same time. Heraclitus' examples. Plato's own examples in the \emph  {Phaedo} suggest that he's concerned primarily with CO. 1. Simias is both taller and shorter; he's taller than X and shorter than Y (102b 2. ``By a head'' (material cause) explains BOTH something's being taller, and its being smaller. 100e5-101b2So, material things suffer from CO. Why does that mean that we can't appeal to them in finding definitions? One idea: Perceptible objects and properties don't give us the right answer to our search for definitions. If we focus on the sorts of properties that are matters of observation, we won't get the right answer, because we'll only come up with properties that pick out F things no more than not-F things. I can't focus on some OBSERVABLE ACT to define justice, b/c any observable thing that I pick out---e.g.\nobreakspace  {}RETURNING WHAT I HAVE BORROWED---in some cases will be just, and in other cases will be unjust. So, this tells us that if we're going to find definitions (and hence get K), we must find something IMPERCEPTIBLE that can serve as the objects of these definitions.
