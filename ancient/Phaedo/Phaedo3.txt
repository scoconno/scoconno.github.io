title: Phaedo 3
--- 


We saw that Socrates searches for answers to the Socratic 'what is x' question. The answers are called Socratic definitions. In the *Phaedo*, we find a new question, 'why is x as it is?' or 'why is x F?' Answering the second question requires finding an *aitia*, which can be translated as either cause or explanation. The questions 'what is x' and 'why is x as it is' are different. The *Euthyphro*, we saw, illustrated what is required to adequately answer the first. The *Phaedo* will do two things. It will show us what is required to answer the second question, and it will show us that there is, surprisingly, a close connection between answers to the 'what is x' question and 'why is x' question. 

It may seem clear that answers to these two questions are related. Someone might respond to the question 'what is ice?' by claiming that it is frozen water, or water that has been frozen. And, this of course, does relate to why ice is as it is, or at least why ice came to be. But not all questions are so obviously related. 'What is Socrates?' and 'Why is Socrates in prison' do not have clearly related answers at all. The former question has as its answer that Socrates is an ensouled the body. The latter has as its answer that Socrates thinks it better to follow the court's execution order. 


## Socrates' intellectual journey
The participants have not yet agreed whether the soul is or is not subject to generation and destruction.
Socrates loses trust in traditional scientific explanations. This results in a deep distrust over explanation: "What is an explanation, whether of generation and destruction or anything else?" He will ultimately answer that explanations are forms. 

We will see two requirements of explanation based on failure. 

+ REQ: If same explanandum, then same explanans.
	+ i.e. it is impossible for numerically different particular things, in so far as they have the same quality, to have different and incompatible explanantia.
	+ i.e. it is necessary that, if E1 is the explanans of why x is f, and E2 is the explanans of why y is f (where x and y are numerically different particulars), then E1 = E2

+ REQ2: If same explanans, then same explanandum
	+ i.e. it is impossible for numerically different particular things, in so far as they have different and incompatible qualities, to have the same explanantia.
	+ i.e. it is necessary that, if E is the explanans of why x is f, and E is the explanans of why y is g (where x and y are numerically different particulars), then f = g

Uniqueness: 
: They are requirements of the uniqueness of explanation because they imply that each explanandum has a single explanans, the one proper to it, and conversely each explanans explains a single explanandum, the one proper to it.

Generality: 
: They are requirements of the generality of explanation because they imply that, if a particular thing, x, has an explanation, it does so in virtue of having a general quality, f. This is a general quality in the sense that numerically different particular things, x and y, can have the same quality, f.


## The positive proposal

*Simple Schema:*
: The explanation of why a thing, x, has a quality, f, is that x is appropriately related directly to the essence of this quality (100b1–102b3)

*Complex Schema:*
: The explanation of why a thing, x, has a quality, f, is that x is appropriately related to something, e.g. a physical thing, which, though not itself an essence, is in turn appropriately related to the essence of this quality, f (102b3–105c7)
