There are two passages this week. They are from *Phaedo*. Please complete **both** and submit through the relevant link on Blackboard. For each, write a separate paragraph for *context*, *content*, and *assessment*. Keep the **total** word count to 500 words, i.e., about 250 words per passage. 

**Passage 1**

It is agreed between us then that the living come from the dead in this way no less than the dead from the living, and, if that is so, it seems to be sufficient proof that the souls of the dead must be somewhere whence they can come back again (72a)

**Passage 2**

Conside then, Cebes, whether it follows from all that has been said that the soul is most like the divine, deathless, and intelligible, uniform, indissoluble, always in the same state as itself, whereas the body is most like that which is human, mortal, multiform, unintelligible, soluble, and never constantly the same (80a-80b).
