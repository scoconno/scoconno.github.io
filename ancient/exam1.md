title: Exam 1
---

Below are several options for your first mid-term exam. **Pick two**. Each option includes some extra instruction for that prompt. Here are some general guidelines: 

1. Write 500-750 words. This does not include the bibliography. 
2. Use only the dialogs, my notes, and the resources listed under 'Ancient Philosophy Resources' to prepare for the exam. 
3. This mid-term will be held in-person on Thursday, October 19th. 
4. If you use your laptop or tabled, you must download the respondus lockdown software. Alternatively, you may submit the exam on paper. 


## Option 1

In the *Euthyphro*, Socrates rejects Euthyphro’s proposal that ''the pious is just what I’m doing now: to proceed against whoever does injustice.'' Imagine that you are Socrates. Explain in simple, modern English, the criteria for an adequate answer to a `What is X? question. Then explain why Euthyphro's proposal does not meet these criteria. (You can ignore the explanatory requirement).

### Further Instruction 

+ This assignment asks you to write from Socrates' perspective. What does that mean? On the hand, you should not be writing phrases like 'Socrates thinks', or 'Socrates believes', etc. I'm asking you to imagine that you are Socrates and write as if you were him. Use the firs person pronoun.
+ A reasonable structure to this paper would include one paragraph explaining the first criteria, another the second criteria, the third testing Euythphro's answer agains the first criteria, and the fourth testing his answer against the second criteria. 
+ Use simple examples throughout your paper. 

## Option 2

In the *Meno*, Socrates responds to Meno's paradox of inquiry. Clearly explain that paradox and explain Socrates's solution to it. 

### Further Instruction

+ The paradox of inquiry has two parts, one concerning beginning an inquiry and the other concerning the end of an inquiry. Dedicate a paragraph to each part. Make sure to use examples in your explanations. 
+ Socrates's solution involves the claim that learning is recollection. Don't merely state that. Try relate that theory back to the paradox by explaining how it allows him reject one of the premises in the paradox. 


## Option 3

In the *Apology*, Socrates defends himself against a number of charges. Clearly outline these **explicit** charges, then discuss how he defends himself against *one* of them. 

### Further Instruction 

+ Make sure to complete both parts of this assignment. One part should explain the charges against Socrates. The second should explain Socrates' defense against one and only one of these charges. 
+ A reasonable structure would consist of one paragraph for each of the charges and then a structured discussion of his response to  whichever one you pick.



## Option 4

In the *Crito*, Socrates argues that it would be wrong for him to escape jail. His argument is a general argument against civil disobedience. Suppose a Covid vaccine mandate applies to you and that this mandate is lawful. Write a letter to some anti-vaccine friend using Socrates' arguments to show that it would be unjust for you to go unvaccinated. Make sure to explicitly compare your argument to Socrates's, i.e., explain how Socrates argument that it is unjust to escape prison is similar to your own. 

### Further Instruction

+ Students picking this prompt should not write a paper too removed from the *Crito*. This paper is about the *Crito*, and you must be fully engaged with the text. This paper, however, is giving you the opportunity to consider how the argument in the *Crito* applies to a debate about the vaccine mandate. Just make sure you write more about the *Crito* than you do about vaccines.
