\section*{Motivating concern for the Stoics}

\noindent The Stoics were very concerned with the following argument
\vspace*{2mm}

[P1] For an action to be ``in our power,'' i.e. for it to be a free action, we must be able to do its opposite\vspace*{1mm}

[P2] Praise and blame (and other responses) are bestowed \emph{only} on free actions
\vspace*{1mm}

[P3] In any situation, the virtuous person cannot act otherwise than she actually does
\vspace*{1mm}

\underline{[P4] In any situation, the virtuous person's action is not free (from [P1] and [P3])}
\vspace*{1mm}

[C] The virtuous person's actions are not praiseworthy (from [P2] and [C1])
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent This argument is meant to be a \emph{reductio}---[C] is supposed to be obviously false---thus, an actions' being free cannot require that the agent be able to do otherwise (`` `in our power'' is not like that'')

\section*{Some Stoic psychology}

\noindent Stoics conceive of the soul as wholly rational (i.e. more like the conception in the \emph{Protagoras} than in the \emph{Republic} or \emph{Aristotle})
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Desire/impulse for \emph{X} = belief that \emph{X} is good or ought to be done; fear of \emph{X} = belief that \emph{X} is harmful; and so on
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Beliefs arise in the following way: 
\vspace*{2mm}

External object impresses itself upon the soul, which generates an ``impression'' or ``presentation'' that\\\hspace*{6mm}something is the case
\vspace*{1mm}

The soul either assents (i.e. accepts the content of the impression) and a belief is formed, or withholds\\\hspace*{6mm}(i.e. does not accept) and a belief is not formed
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Virtue, for the Stoics, is a state of the soul which is causally responsible for actions (so, the Stoics don't want to reject [P3] above)
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Virtuous person has knowledge of what is good and bad; non-virtuous person has an inconsistent belief-set about what is good and bad

\section*{Stoic view vs. a Libertarian view}

\noindent Differing notions of \emph{free action}:
\vspace*{2mm}

Libertarian: An action is free only if it is possible for X to have chosen not to do it \textbf{even though} everything\\\hspace*{6mm}relevant to X's choice to do A \textbf{except} his ``will'' remains the same---e.g. his beliefs, his character, the\\\hspace*{6mm}external world
\vspace*{2mm}

Stoic: An action is free only if it is caused by the agent's beliefs and desires

\section*{Determinism and Freedom}

\noindent The Stoics become worried about human freedom in a way that just did not seem to be on Plato and Aristotle's radar
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent According to Chrysippus: ``Fate is a sempiternal and unchangeable series and chain of things, rolling and unravelling itself through eternal sequences of cause and effect, of which it is composed and compounded'' (II-89)
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent The Stoics attempt to reconcile determinism with human freedom by distinguishing two kinds of causes of events:
\vspace*{2mm}

[A] Auxiliary and proximate (e.g. shoving the cylinder; an impression)
\vspace{1mm}

[B] Perfect and Principal (e.g. the rollability of the cylinder)
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent There are different kinds of causal mechanisms
\vspace*{2mm}

Thing-like mechanisms [cylinder model]
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace*{5mm} External world + nature of thing $\rightarrow$ effect
\vspace*{1mm}

Rational mechanisms [agency model]
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace*{5mm} [1] External world + perceptual nature of person $\rightarrow$ have impression
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace*{5mm} [2] Have impression + assent to impression $\rightarrow$ believe content of impression
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace*{5mm} [3] Belief + character $\rightarrow$ effect
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent \emph{Human freedom}
\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Humans differ from things: our individual beliefs and characters are part of the causal process
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent The impressions which we have are causally determined by the state of the external world
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent Our acceptance of rejection of impressions is not causally determined by the external world
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent Free action = action not causally determined by the external world
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent Hence, human action is free
