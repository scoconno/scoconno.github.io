title: Parmenides' Challenge

---

## Introduction

Parmenides of Elea, current day Italy, was active in the earlier part of the 5th c. BCE. He is part of a school of philosophy called the *Eleatics*. We will learn about his student Zeno later in the course. 


'On Nature', the work we are studying, was written in hexameter verse, a standard meter for poems of this type. Homer's *Odyssey*, for instance, was written in hexameter. We will study the poem in translation, but it is near impossible to recreate this particular Greek meter in English. So, keep in mind two things: 1) the translation of ancient Greek is not easy and  the translation of several passages is contested, 2) Parmenides intended his readers to hear this as a poem. 

Here is what the poem looks like in the original Greek. 


> 1. Ἵπποι, ταί με φέρουσιν, ὅσον τ ̓ ἐπὶ θυμὸς ἱκάνοι 
2.  πέμπον, ἐπεί μ ̓ ἐς ὁδὸν βῆσαν πολύφημον ἄγουσαι     
3. δαίμονος, ἣ κατὰ πάντ ̓ ἄ<ν>τη<ν> φέρει εἰδότα φῶτα·     
4. τῇ φερόμην, τῇ γάρ με πολύφραστοι φέρον ἵπποι    5. ἅρμα τιταίνουσαι, κοῦραι δ ̓ ὁδὸν ἡγεμόνευον.   
6. ἄξων δ ̓ ἐν χνοίῃσιν ἵ<ει> σύριγγος ἀυτὴν  
7. αἰθόμενος, δοιοῖς γὰρ ἐπείγετο δινωτοῖσιν  
8. κύκλοις ἀμφοτέρωθεν, ὅτε σπερχοίατο πέμπειν  
9. ἡλιάδες κοῦραι προλιποῦσαι δώματα νυκτὸς  10. ἐς φάος, ὠσάμεναι κράτων ἄπο χερσὶ καλύπτρας.

Unfortunately, the full poem has not survived. What has survived are various fragments that have been copied and passed on. These fragments allow us a good understanding of the poem, which is now standardly taken to have contained three parts. The first part is called the 'proem', a kind of introductory phase in which Parmenides describes a mystical trip to the halls of a Goddess, most likely the Goddess Nyx (night). The Goddess describes to Parmenides three roads of inquiry and argues that only one road will lead to the truth. The second part of the poem argues that the road of truth involves inquiry into 'what is' or 'being'. Two other roads are rejected, inquiry into 'what is not' or 'non-being', and the inquiry into 'what is and is not', the road of mortals. Whatever the correct the interpretation, the Goddess thinks that any judgement that either directly or indirectly concerns non-being is false. The third part of the poem concerns Parmenides' view on the cosmology that contains fewest mistakes. I do not include that below.  

Before tackling the poem, it is important to recognize that Parmenides holds radical views. We can perhaps agree with him that there is a different between how something appears and how something really is. After all, all of us have had the experience of something appearing one way, but discovering that we were mistaken. Perhaps you were ill and believed what was, in reality, a cold room to be very hot. Or, perhaps you saw or heard something when really tried that was not really there at all. There is no difficulty in accepting that our appearances are sometimes mistaken. But, Parmenides goes further and claims that all of our appearances are mistaken, at least all our appearances of a world populated by discrete, changing, and temporary beings. 

This claim may seem radical and it is. But it has some affinities to some of the main commitments of Hinduism and perhaps Buddhism. According to Vedanta school of Hinduism, the world of appearance is the world of maya, the presentation of things that come in and out of existence, alter, and move. It is the world in which many different beings appear to exist. But maya in this tradition is also a false world. The Vedanta school believes that true reality is brahman, which is unchanging, whole, and eternal. Spiritual practices were developed to help us  overcome maya, help us rid of ourselves of the delusion that the world of appearance is the real world (and also the apparent delusion that we each are separate beings). So, if Parmenides is radical, then so is anyone whose religious practice focuses on ridding what they take to be their belief in the world of appearance.  


## Summary of Parmenides' Strategy

While the argument is difficult, the general strategy is clear: 

1. Parmenides wants to argue that nothing can (i) be created or destroyed, (ii) alter, grow, or, move, (iii) be divided into parts or from any other being, (iv) be incomplete, i.e., lacking in some size. 
2. He wants to argue that since i-iv are true, the only thing that exists is something that lacks these traits, i.e., he wants to argue for monism, the claim that only one thing exists.  
3. His argument for 1 relies on the claim that each predicate mentioned in (i)-(iv) would entail the existence of non-being, i.e., a location that the sphere is not, a time when the baby is not.
4. His argument against non-being relies on some relationship between thought/language and its referents. 


The interpreter's main task is to properly identify why he thinks that we cannot think about non-being *and* show how this claim allows him for monism. 



## Argument for 1

Perhaps the simplest version of Parmenides' argument for (1) is as follows: 

+ P1. If X exists, then X is a possible object of thought. 
+ P2. If X is a possible object of thought, then X exists. 
+ C1. Therefore, if X does not exist, then X cannot be thought about.

Premise 1 (P1) tells us that any existing thing must be a possible object of thought. By *possible object of thought*, I do not mean that someone must actually have that thought. For instance, dinosaurs are possible objects of thoughts. This does not mean that there are people actually thinking about dinosaurs. It means that nothing about the nature of dinosaurs prevents them being thought about. To put this metaphorically: if God exists, then nothing about dinosaurs would prevent him thinking about them. Contrast this to, say, being the object of taste. Many things are not possible objects of taste, e.g., the number 3, sentences, etc. The reason they are not objects of taste lies in their nature; they cannot interact with a tongue and generate a taste sensation. 

So, P1 is making the very minor point that existing things are such that they can be thought about. This seems very plausible. I challenge you to think of an existing thing that cannot be thought about! 

The difficult premise is premise 2 (P2). Parmenides assume that any possible object of thought must also some entity that really exists. If you successfully think about Santa Clause--if Santa is a possible object of thought--, then Santa Clause really exists. Why Parmenides accept such a radical claim?  Bertrand Russell tried to explain it as follows: 

> When you think, you think of something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something. Therefore both thought and language require objects outside themselves. (Bertrand Russell)

Russell has in mind here a simple argument: 
+ P3. A name is meaningful only if it refers to something that possibly exists. 
+ P4. A proposition is meaningful only if the names within that sentence are meaningful.
+ P5. A proposition is true or false only if it is meaningful
+ C2. Therefore, a proposition containing an empty name---a name which does not refer---is meaningless and so neither true or false. 

P3 says simply that the meaning of name is its reference. Consider the name 'Barack Obama'. P3 says that the meaning of this name is just the man the name refers to. So too the name 'New Jersey City University'. It's name is just the institution that it refers to. If P3 is true, then the meaning of the name, 'Santa Clause' just is the person that it refers to. But, unfortunately, Santa does not exist. Thus, the name does not have a meaning. 

Consider now the sentence,'Santa Clause lives in the North Pole'. Is this sentence true? P5 tells us that a sentence can be true (or false) only if it is meaningful. But P4 tells us that the a sentence can be meaningful only if the names within that sentence have meaning. Since our sentence contains an empty name, it is meaningless. Thus, it cannot be true. 

One way to make this problem acute is to consider sentences that explicitly deny that something exists, which might be Parmenides' real worry. Suppose you believe that Santa Clause does not exist. If you believe this, then you think that the following sentence is true: 

>  'Santa Clause does not exist.' 

(Note that philosophers put a single quotation mark around a phrase in order to indicate they are speaking about the sentence and not the referent of the sentence). 

Is the sentence true? P5 tells us that it can be true only if it is meaningful. P4 tells us that it is meaningful only if the names it contains are meaningful, e.g., if 'Santa Clause' is meaningful. And P3 tells us that the meaning of a name is what it refers to. 

So, if our sentence is meaningful, then the name 'Santa Clause' has a referent, its meaning is the person it refers to. Therefore, if our sentence is meaningful, it is false. It is false because there is an existing thing that the name refers to. If, however, the name has no meaning, then the whole sentence is meaningless. And, if the whole sentence is meaningless, P5 tells us that the sentence can be neither true nor false. Thus, if the name has no referent, the claim that 'Santa Clause does not exist' is meaningless. The upshot is that we cannot meaningful assert a true denial of Santa's existence. This applies generally: you cannot both meaningfully assert that something does not exist and, at the same time, be speaking truly. S. Marc Cohen makes the point in this wonderful way: 

> “*x* does not exist” is not true unless *x* does not exist. But if the subject of a statement does not exist, the statement is not meaningful. The problem with negative existentials is this: a necessary condition of their truth is a sufficient condition of their meaninglessness. (S. Marc Cohen)


## Signs of Truth

Keep fixed this upshot as we continue. Call it U: 
: If X does not exist and you believe that you have *successfully* thought or talked about X, then your belief is false. 

Parmenides will use U to generate some remarkable claims about the true nature of reality. His strategy consists in showing how various ordinary beliefs about the world assume that something does not exist, i.e., in showing that a variety of ordinary beliefs violate U. I present these below, but I won't add much commentary. It's relatively straightforward to see how U figures in the arguments. I will use Socrates as an example, but the arguments can be applied to anything whatsoever. 


### 1. Generation & Destruction

1.  If Socrates comes into existence, then there is a time when Socrates did not exist.
2.  If there is a time when Socrates did not exist, then it must be possible to think and say that Socrates did not exist. 
3.  It is impossible to think and say that Socrates did not exist (for it is impossible to think and say that anything does not exist).
4.  Therefore, Socrates did not come into existence. 


*Consequence for Time*:
: If there is no generation and no destruction, then there can be no temporal difference

> Nor was it ever nor will it be, since it is now, all together, one, holding together. ... it is right either fully to be or not.

1. If time 1 differs from a later time 2, then time 1 has gone out of existence and time 2 has come into existence. 
2. If time 1 has gone out of existence, it must be possible to think and say that time 1 does not exist. 
3. It is impossible to think and say that time 1 does not exist (for it is impossible to think and say that anything does not exist). 
4. Therefore, time 1 has not gone out of existence. 
5. Therefore, time 1 does not differ from any later times. 
 
The claim that time comes into or goes out of existence could mean either that temporal moments are entities that come into or go out of existence, or it could mean that the state of the universe as a whole comes into or out of existence. 

## 2. Change 

### Alteration: change in qualities

1. If Socrates sickens, then he has changed from being healthy to being sick. 
2. If Socrates changes from being healthy to being sick, then his health goes out of existence and his sickness comes into existence.
3. The changes described in 2 involve generation & destruction, which are both impossible (for it is impossible to think and say that anything does not exist).
4. Therefore, Socrates cannot sicken.  

*What goes out of existence in these cases:* (i) the property, e.g, being healthy, being red, being warm, etc., (ii) The state that Socrates is someway, e.g., that Socrates is healthy, that Socrates is red, that Socrates is warm, etc. (ii) The unusual object that has Socrates and a property as parts, e.g., the-healthy-Socrates, the-warm-Socrates, the-red-Socrates, etc. 


### Movement: change in location

*Version 1*

1. If Socrates moves to location 2 from location 1, then there is some time when location 2 is empty. 
2. If location 2 is empty, then location 2 is nothing. 
3. Location 2 cannot be a non-existent thing. 
4. Therefore, Socrates cannot move to location 2.

*Version 2*

1. If Socrates moves from location 1 to location 2, then Socrates is at location 1 at one time and location 2 at a different time.  
3. Time does not exist. 
4. Therefore, Socrates cannot move from location 1 to location 2. 


## 3. Completeness ##

1. If Socrates occupies some location, but not all locations, there is some location where he is not
2. If there some location where he is not, then that location does not exist. 
3. That is impossible. 
4. Therefore, Socrates must occupy all locations. 


### 4.  Plurality

*Version 1*
1. If X and Y are numerically distinct, then something, A,  must separate X and Y. 
2. A cannot be nothing. 
3. Therefore, A is some existing thing. 
4. If A is some existing thing, then something, B, must separate X and A, and something, C, must separate Y and A. 
5. B and C cannot be nothing. 
6. Therefore, B and C are some existing things. 
7. By similar reasoning, X and Y are never separated from other beings.
8. Therefore, X and Y are not numerically distinct. 


*Version 2*

1. If there were two things, say Superman and Batman, it would be true to say that one of them is not the other.
2. If Superman is not Batman, then it must be possible to think of not-Batman. 
3. It is not possible to think of not-Batman.
3. Therefore, Superman are numerically identical. 

*Version 3*

1. If there were two things, say Superman and Batman, there would be some property, P, such that Superman had P and Batman did not have P
2. If Superman does not have P, then it must be possible to think of not-P. 
3. It is not possible to think of not-P. 
4. Therefore, Superman and Batman are numerically identical.

title: Responses to Parmenides
---

Parmenides' challenge was felt acutely. Scientists, called natural philosophers back then, insisted that the world of change existed.  But, they recognized that they needed to describe a world of change that could avoid Parmenides' challenge. So, they took care to articulate their own views in ways that allowed them to avoid the implication that 'what is not' is, i.e., they articulated accounts of change and the changing world while avoiding saying and thinking about what is not. One interesting feature of these research projects is how radical the positions were that scientists adopted to avoid the challenge; Parmenides' predecessors rescued the world of change in ways that still questioned the veracity of the world of appearance. This table summarizes the various ways Parmenides' predecessors differed from him. 


|	| Parmenides  | Empedocles  | The Atomists  | Aristotle |
| :----------: |:-----------:| :-----:| :--------: |:-------:|
| Gen. & Dest. | No  | No 	|  No	| Yes |
| Motion     | No     |   Yes | Yes |  Yes |
| Alteration | No      |   Yes |	No |	Yes |
| Plurality  | No      |   Yes | Yes |  Yes |
| Empty space | No     |   No	| Yes | No |

 

## The verb to be 

> For it is impossible to come to be from **what in no way is**, and it is not to be accomplished and is unheard of that what is **perishes absolutely**. (Empedocles, B12)

Notice the qualifications that I have highlighted. The verb 'to be' can be used in different ways. One of the central responses to Parmenides is to exploit these different ways to identify mistakes in his argument. The two ways are what we call the 'existential' and the 'predicative' uses of the verb. Compare the following: 


+ Socrates is not at all. *vs*
+ Socrates is not short.

+ There is no chocolate in the fridge. *vs*
+ The chocolate is not cheap.

+ 'To be or not to be.' (Hamlet)
+ 'Do you want to be a doctor or a lawyer?'

The predicative use of 'to be', the copula, always requires some complement. For instance, if I intend the copula, the following are incomplete sentences: 

+ Socrates is___
+ Socrates is not___
+ I am___
+ I am not___

The existential sense of the verb 'to be' does not need a complement to form a sentence. We can mark this by replacing 'is' with exists. Consider the following: 

+ I exist.
+ Socrates does not exist. 

It makes not sense to say, 'I exist doctor'. The distinction between the existential and predicative uses of 'to be' allows us to read in different ways Parmenides' primary injunction against thinking about what is not. 

+ It is impossible to think about what does not exist. 
+ It is impossible to think about what does not have any property. 
+ It is impossible to think about what does not have some property.

If something does not exist, then perhaps we will agree with Parmenides that it cannot be a possible object of thought. And, if an object has no property whatsoever, then it does not exist. So, such things too could not be possible objects of thought. However, it does not follow from the fact that an object lacks some specific property that it does not exist. For instance, it does not follow from the fact that Socrates is not red that Socrates does not exist. Socrates failing to be red is compatible with him having plenty of other properties, e.g., he is human, tall, Greek, etc. So, the fact that Socrates fails to have one property does not entail that he is not a possible object of thought. 

## Empedocles
Empedocles responds to Parmenides with a concession and a rebuttal. To articulate the response, let us consider Parmenides' argument against the reality of change in the following way:

+ P1. Change involves coming to be from what is not
+ P2. We cannot think about what is not
+ C. So, change is unthinkable. 

I just suggested that P2 should be read with the existential version of 'to be'. So, it should be read as follows:

+ P1`. Change involves coming to exist from what does not exist. 
+ P2`. We cannot think about what does not exist. 
+ C`. So, change is unthinkable. 

Empedocles agrees with P2`. He agrees, in effect, that change is impossible if it involves coming to be from what does not exist. This is why Empedocles denies that there is any generation or destruction: 

> ...There is coming to be of not a single one of all mortal things, nor is there any end of deadly death ....(Empedocles B8)

This is a reasonable point to make if we assume that Socrates' generation involves Socrates changing from not-existing to existing. Socrates' generation, then, would involve Socrates coming to exist from what does not exist. A similar argument can be run for destruction. 

Empedocles agrees with Parmenides on this point, that there is no generation or destruction. But, he denies that every change involves coming from what does not exist. Many changes, Empedocles claims, are best described as coming from what is not F, where 'F' denotes some property or other. For instance, Socrates' music lesson is best described as Socrates becoming musical from being unmusical. His catching a cold is best described as him becoming sick from being healthy. The descriptions of these changes uses the predicative sense of 'to be' and not the existential sense of the verb. Parmenides' argument fails when we describe change using the predicative sense of the verb 'to be'.

+ P1``. Change involves coming to be F from what is not F.
+ P2``. We cannot think about what does not exist. 
+ C``. So, change is unthinkable. 

This argument is not valid; the conclusion does not follow from the premises. It is analogous to the following argument: 

+ Every bank is adjacent to some river.
+ The Chase building on Lexington and 72nd is a bank. 
+ Therefore, the Chase building is adjacent to some river. 

Obviously, this is invalid because it confuses two meanings of the word 'bank'; the conclusion does not follow from the premises. There is a difference between money banks and river banks. Likewise, if 'to be' is used in one way to describe change and a used a different way to describe what we cannot think about, then the argument in invalid.  

## Empedocles' positive theory

Notice that Empedocles does not believe in generation and destruction. He does not believe that cats are born, trees rot, paintings are created, etc. He agrees with Parmenides that such changes are impossible. His disagreement with Parmenides is over other kinds of change, changes like coming to be sick from being healthy. He thinks that Parmenides' argument fails to disprove the existence of such changes. Empedocles proceeds to offer a cosmology that relies only on some eternal elements and their alterations.  

> Hear first the four roots of all things: Shining Zeus [fire] and life-bringing Hera [air] and Aidoneus [earth] and Nestis [water] who with her tears moistens mortal Springs. (B6)

> And these [sc. the elements] never cease continually interchanging, at one time all coming together into one by Love, and at another each being borne apart by the hatred of Strife. (43=B17, line 6)


Empedocles here identifies six principles, four passive principles, and two active principles. 


| Active Principles  | Passive Principles  | 
| :--------: |:-------:|
| Love | Earth    |   
| Strife  | Fire     | 
| | Water  |   
| | Air |   

The idea is that love brings various portion of elements together and strife separates them. Compare this to lego blocks. There is one process that brings some lego blocks together and another process that brings the lego blocks apart. This point, by itself, may seem compatible with generation and destruction. Perhaps Empedocles just wants to say that things are generated from various elements via love and destroyed via strife. But, Empedocles denies generation and destruction. Instead, he is trying to explain why it might *appear* to us that there is generation and destruction: 


> Whenever they [sc. the elements] arrive in the aither mixed so as to form a man or one of the wild beasts or bushes or birds, that is when <people> speak of coming into being; and whenever they are separated, that <is what they call> the ill-starred fate of death. They do not call it as is right, but I myself too assent to their convention (B9).

> There is ... only mixture, and separation of what is mixed, and nature [or, birth, phusis] is the name given to them by humans. (B8)

So, Empedocles accepts that it appears to us that babies are born and tress die. But, he claims that what *really* happens in these cases is that various elements are coming together and separating. These elements are changing in their features, but none of these changes count as a generation or destruction: 

> For from these [sc. the elements] come all things that were and are and will be in the future. Trees have sprouted and men and women, and beasts and birds and fishes nurtured in water, and long-lived gods highest in honors. **For there are just these things [i.e., the elements], and running through one another they come to have different appearances,** for mixture changes them. (B21)


## The Atomists

The atomists are another group of philosophers who responded to Parmenides. Unlike Empedocles, they argued that reality comprised infinite numbers of imperceptible atoms. These atoms vary in size and shape. They are indivisible and eternal; the atomists denied that such things are generated or destroyed because that would involved them coming into or out of existence. Reality, the atomists contended, consisted in these atoms bumping into one another and moving apart in space. The result of this behavior is the appearance of various entities being generated and destroyed, e.g., it appears that cats are born and trees rot. But, there aren't really any cats and trees. There just appears to be so. One of the most interesting features of the atomists' account is how they respond to Parmenides' argument that there is no empty space. 

+ P1. Empty space is not
+ P2. We cannot think about what does not exist. 
+ C. Empty space is unthinkable. 

The atomists respond that P1 should not be construed as the claim that empty space does not exist. Aristotle presents their view as follows: 

> All thinkers agree in making the opposites principles, both those who describe the All as one and unmoved, for even Parmenides treats hot and cold as principles under the names fire and earth, and those too who use the rare and the dense. The same is true of Democritus also, with his plenum and the void, both of which exists, he says, the one as what is, the other as what is not (Aristotle *Physics*, 188a19–23).

So, the atomists claim there are two ways to read the first premise: 

+ Empty space does not exist. 
+ Empty space is not full.

Parmenides' argument works on the former reading of the premise, but it does not work on the latter reading of the premise: the fact that empty space is not full does not entail that empty space does not exist. 


## Aristotle 

Aristotle was not willing to deny even the existence of generation and destruction; he thought it more likely that Parmenides had erred than that our beliefs in such change were false. But he respected Parmenides, and he thought responding appropriately required properly characterizing the most basic structure of change, on the one hand, and clearly describing the proper subjects of generation and destruction on the other. We will focus on his account of change first. 

**Claim 1: all change occurs between opposites** 

> White comes from not-white, and not from any not-white, but from black or some intermediate. Similarly, musical comes to be from non-musical, but not from any thing other than musical, but from unmusical or any intermediate state there may be. [188b1]

> Nor again do things pass away into the first chance thing; white does not pass into musical (except, it may be, accidentally), but into not-white—and not into any chance thing which is not white, but into black or an intermediate; musical passes into not-musical–and not into any chance thing other than musical, but into unmusical or any intermediate state there may be. [188b4]

> If then this is true, everything that comes to be or passes away comes from, or passes into, its contrary or an intermediate state. [188b21]

Distinguish two claims: 

1. Socrates becomes healthy from being not-healthy. 
2. Socrates becomes healthy from being sick. 

Our first claim may appear to speak about what does not exist, i.e., about the non-existence of health. But, the second claim speaks of some existing thing, i.e., it speaks about the existing sickness that Socrates possessed. Aristotle wants to emphasize that change can be described in ways that avoid speaking about what strictly does not exist. 

**Claim 2: there is a subject of change distinct from those opposites the change occurs between**

> Granted then, that they [the principles of nature] are a limited number, it is plausible to assume them more than two. For it is difficult to see how either density should be of such a nature to make rarity something or rarity is such to make density something. The same is true of any other pair of opposites; for Love does not gather Strife together and make things out of it, nor does Strife make anything out of Love, but both make a third thing something. Some indeed assume more than one such thing from which they construct the nature of beings (189a21–27).

Aristotle believes that every change has the same structure: some subject has one opposite before the change and another opposite afterwards. (One of these opposites may be replaced by an intermediate.) He illustrates the point with a simple example of a music lesson: When a person becomes musical, the person is the subject, and 'musical' and 'unmusical' are the opposites the change occurs between. Before the change the man was unmusical or an intermediate; afterwards he is musical.

The problem, though, is how to apply this model to generation and destruction: what is the subject and the pair of opposites involved in generation and destruction? Aristotle's answer has two parts. First, he emphasizes that there is a difference between substances and their predicates, and he claims that, strictly, it is only substances that are generated and destroyed. We use the phrase 'substantial change' often to indicate that it is really only substances that come into or go out of existence: 

Substance: 
: X is a substance if and only if (i) X is not predicated of anything else, and (ii) other things are predicated of X. 

Predicate:
: Y is a predicate if and only if there is some, Z, such that Y is predicated of Z.

The subjects and opposites involved in alterations, growth, and locomotion are easy enough believes Aristotle. The subject is always a substance and never a predicate. The opposites are always predicates and never substances. But what is the subject and opposites involved in the generation and destruction of substances? Aristotle's second important claim in his analysis of generation & destruction begins as follows: 

> For in every case there is something that is a subject from which the thing that comes into being [comes into being], as plants and animals come into being from sperma. Some of the things that come into being without qualification [i.e., substances] do so by change of figure (for instance, a statue); some by addition (for instance, growing things); some by subtraction (for instance, Hermes from the stone); some by composition (for instance, a house); some by alteration (for instance, by being turned [into something else] in accordance with matter). It is evident that everything that comes to be in this way comes to be from a subject (190b3–10).

Aristotle here emphasizes that there really are subjects from which substances are generated. Statues, for instances, are created from stone. Aristotle goes on to call the various subjects that substances are generated from 'matter' and the opposite that is gained in the change 'form' (or 'shape). So, when Socrates is generated, some matter gains some form. The reason this differs from mere alterations is that Socrates has not changed in one of his features. Rather, by matter taking on a new form, there is a now a new object that has the form and the matter as parts. 

> Suppose, then, that there are indeed causes and principles of natural beings, from which they primarily are and have come to be – not come to be coincidentally, but come to be what each thing is called in accordance with its essence. It evidently follows that everything comes to be from the subject and the shape. For in a way the musical man is composed from man and musical, since you will analyze him into their accounts. It is clear, then, that whatever comes to be does so from these things (190b17–23).10

## Aristotle's response to Parmenides

Aristotle presents Parmenides' puzzle as follows:

> The first of those who studied philosophy were misled in their search for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were thrust them into another path. So they say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible. For what is cannot come to be (because it is already), and from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must be underlying). [191a25]

He responds by making a point similar to Empedocles: to say that something comes 'from what is' is ambiguous. Similarly, to say that something comes 'from what is not' is ambiquous. Aristotle will agree that some readings are problematic, but he insists that others are not. Focusing on 'what is' first and using Socrates as an example. It could mean: 

1. Socrates comes from what is already Socrates. 
2. Socrates comes from what exists. 
3. Socrates comes from something that has some feature or other. 

Aristotle agrees with Parmenides that 1 is impossible. But he thinks that 2 and 3 are perefectly possible. This is the route that many of those after Parmenides also took. The real novelty comes with his account of 'what is not'. The claim that Socrates comes from 'what is not' could mean: 

1. Socrates comes from what is not (already) Socrates.
2. Socrates comes from what does not exist. 

Aristotle agrees with 2. He accepts that Socrates cannot come from what does not exist (such a thing would be nothing at all). But, Aristotle thinks 1 is perfectly possible. Socrates comes from some matter that is not yet Socrates, but can still be turned into Socrates (when the relevant form is imposed on Socrates). Likewise, a house comes from a pile of bricks that are not yet a house, but a pile that can be turned into a house (when they are arranged--informed--in the right way). Aristotle's point is that claims of type 1 do not require us to think and speak about non-existing entities. It requires that we speak and think about matter that does not yet have some relevant form. But when we do this, we are thinking and speaking about some existing thing.
