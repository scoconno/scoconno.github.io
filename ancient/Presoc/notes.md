Date of Home

Augustine died in AD 430

Presocratics: philosophy develops through the successive speculative systems of the Presocratic naturalists. General views about nature and origin of the world, sometime mythological, sometimes scientific. 

Critical: S, P, A construct philoosphy a distinct discipline from mythology and science

Major themes

1. Epistemology: philosophers seek to know and udnerstand the world, but they ask questions about how we get knowledge, about what it is, nature of observation, perception, etc. 
2. Metaphysics: inquire into the nature of reality and whether science is exhaustive. 
3. Ethics: raiontla understanding of morality; principles to guide human conduct and justify political structures. The nature of a person’s good, and how it relates to others. 
4. Theology: they want to understand the nature and origin of the world, and our place in it. This often involves engagement with and assessment of religious outlooks. 

# Chapter 2: Homer

Homer, if a person, lived around 750 BC. His works, two long poems, are set c.1200 BC. The Odyssey and the Iliad. Likely lived in Ionia, in Turkey. 

Illiad begins: 

Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,

the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans, 

From  Homer many Greeks drew central and influential, not always conscious, elements of their conception of the gods and the relation of gods to human beings, and they drew a moral outlook and ideal that remained influential long after it had been thoroughly criticized.

It is not surprising, then, that later philosophers regularly quote and allude to Homer. 5 He is not always an authority; indeed, he is sometimes a target, since thoughtful Greeks attack and challenge his views on morality and religion. 6 To see what they thought they should challenge, we too should begin with  Homer.

## Trojan war

+ The Greeks do not have a bible. The closest they have is the Odyssey and Illiad. The youth studied and memorized it, it was put on at games, etc. Sophocles, Aeschylus, and the playwrights wrote plays about the various characters, writing stories about what happened to them before, during, and after the war. Sculptors sculpted based on it. Poets and singers sung about them. Vases were covered with images, etc. 
+ It's set about 1200 BC, but homer lived about 800 BC. 
+ Zeus asks Paris, a prince of Troy, to judge which of the goddesses, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite is the fairest. 
+ He picks Aphrodite, and she makes Helen fall for Paris. Sometimes this is depicted as an abduction. Sometimes this is depicted as a seduction. 
+ Helen is married to Menelaus, the king of Sparta. Menelaus is the brother of Agamemnon, king of the Mycenaeans and head of a league of Achaeans. 
+ Achilles is the best of the Greeks. Agamemnon wants him and his Myrmidons, and he send Odysseus to recruit him. He is a demi-God, son of a sea nymph Thetis. 
+ The Trojan war last ten years with heroes like Ajax and Achilles leading various excursions throughout Trojan lands. The last days of the war see a dramatic rift between Achilles and Agamemnon. During one Achilles' outings, he captures several slaves, including Briseis. Agamemnon demands her for himself, which is a huge slight on Achille's honor. After submitting to Agamemnon, Achilles refuses to fight and the withdrawal of his Myrmidon turns the war in Troy's favor. 
+ Achilles' life long companion, Patroclus, disagrees with this decision. Their relationship is legendary. For some, it is the idea same-sex relationship. Alexander is said to have modeled his romantic relationship with Hephaistion on Achilles' and Patroclus. For others, it is a model of platonic friendship. The debate is torturous. Those who engage it assume that a strong distinction between romantic and non-romantic love, but we don't have such an obvious distinction amongst the Greeks. Greeks at this stage seemed attracted to youth and beauty in both genders, and do not seem to have words to discriminate heterosexual and homosexual relationships. 
+ Patroclus dresses as Achilles, and he leads the Myrmidons to battle; they think he's Achilles. He's killed by Hector, a prince of Troy, brother of Priam. 
+ Achilles is inconsolable, and his rage drives him to destroy many Trojan warriors, demands a duel with Hector. Hector knows he will likely loose, and that doing so will put Troy at risk. But, with his family looking on, honor forces him to agree. He is killed, and Achilles drags his body around the battlefield, bringing his body back to us tent. This is hugely sacrilegious. Priam, Hector's father, sneaks into Achilles' camp and begs his son's return. Achilles demurs. 
+ The war ends with a trick. Odysseus builds a horse that allows lots of soldiers hide in it. They leave it on the battlefield, hide, and make it seem they have given up the field. The Trojans let them it, and the ten year war is brought to an end. The Greeks sack the city, destroy temples, etc. The Gods are furious and most of the actors never make it home. Some Trojans survive and legend has it that Aeneas, one survivor, leads the remainder to Italy and establishes Rome. 
+ 'The Odyssey' describes Odysseus ten year journey home. 

 

## Homeric Ethics

Two main issues: 

1. What is goodness, excellence, or virtue (three ways of rendering the Greek *areté*?) By this, we mean to ask what is the best life for a human to live. What kind of activities do they engage in? What kind of goods must one possess to live the best life? 
2. What are our obligations to one another? 



Greek morality was very much modeled on the morality of heroes like Achilles, who is called the best amongst the Greeks. 



**Characteristics of a good person**

1. Birth: one must be born into a noble family to be good.
2. Wealth: one must be rich to be good.
3. Strength: one must be physically fit to be good. 
4. Good in battle
   1. Strength (Ajax)
   2. Skill (Odysseus and Achilles)
   3. Courage (Achilles, Hector)

5. Honors
   1. Other people's good opinion
   2. Wins trophies, gifts 
   3. Has many minion. The more he has the more powerful he is.

6. He is better than others. 
   1. Achilles father sent him "to always be the best and to excellent the others." 

Which of these are within the agent's control? Which involve other people? 



### Obligations to others

The hero is expected to have concern for others, but theses concerns are instrumental and secondary to his primary concern, which consists in glory and honor. 

- Heroes are expected to have **some** **concern for others**

- - - Hector's concern for Andromache and Astyanax
    - Achilles' concern for Patroclus
    - Achilles and Agamemnon are blamed for neglecting the army's welfare

  - The basic rule is that one is expected to have concern for one's inferiors

- Heroes are expected **not to be indifferent to suffering**

- - - Achilles' treatment of Hector's corpse is clearly an outrage (the episode with Priam shows us that)
    - Patroclus moves Achilles by appeal to the suffering of the army b/c of Achilles' absence

  - Heroes are expected to have sympathy for those who are helpless.

  - Those who fail to show such feelings are beasts, not human

- BUT, in spite of those expectations, **heroes are not praised for their concern for others**: Achilles is not less good because he acts selfishly. There is no suggestion that his reputation will suffer from his selfish actions.

- BUT if he had been enslaved, he would have lost his good reputation! **The day of enslavement, a person loses his virtue**.

- 

- Namely, they serve to enhance the more important aspect of a hero's goodness, namely his reputation and material honor.

- But not all are purely instrumental: nonetheless, they are clearly secondary to the big boldfaced ones above.

- A hero is never expected to sacrifice his reputation or material honors for others

- - - That would diminish his honor
    - Which would diminish his ability to protect and further his followers
    - When Achilles returns to battle, he returns because as much because he failed to protect Patroclus and that made him look weak as because of love for Patroclus

  - Consider Hector, the most other-regarding of the heroes

  - - Twice he chooses his honor over protecting his family and city

    - - He chooses to fight Achilles
      - He admits that withdrawing in battle would serve Troy's interest better, but does not do so because of honor

  - THE UPSHOT OF IT ALL IS THAT OTHERS ARE IMPORTANT BUT SECONDARY



### Comparison to today's society

- Why is Homeric ethics reasonable?

- - Wealth, honor, status, power are all achievable.

  - It is clear and intelligible

  - It is not clear that it is wrong

  - It is not clear that our society today does not follow it in many ways

  - - A somewhat clear example: the mafia



+ Some goods are outside his control: 

1. A good person must have been born into a good family, and must himself be rich and strong;  Homer suggests that a person loses half his goodness on the day he becomes a slave. 
2. Though  Homer does not consider those who win wealth without being nobly born, those who share his outlook refuse to recognize such people as genuinely good. The hereditary, social, and material components of a person's goodness are so important that, if you have them, you remain a good person, even if you behave badly. 
3. The shirker  Paris fails to perform morally good actions, but remains a good man because he meets the other conditions for being good. To this extent a person's goodness is not in his control.

he leading characters of the Iliad are heroes of a past age; their g were unequalled in  Homer's own time. But what Homer counts as goodness is not the sort of thing that we might most readily think of as such.

+ Some aspects of it are in his control:
  1. he is expected to display his excellence in his actions, characteristically and ideally the actions of a warrior and leader. A good man excels in battle, and his characteristic virtues are strength, skill, and courage. 
  2. He is born into a leading place in society with a large share of its resources, and he has the virtues he needs to defend his place against attack. Hence he is expected to excel.
  3. Achilles' father sent him to  Troy 'always to be best and to excel the others'; and, like the other main characters,  Achilles tries to achieve preeminence in the qualities and actions that make a person's excellence.  Achilles is the 'best of the Achaeans', above all because he is pre-eminent in these virtues; and these are the virtues his father had in mind when he wanted  Achilles to excel the others. 
  4. Self-defence also requires the intelligence to form plans, and the skill to persuade others to co-operate in carrying them out. But these virtues are secondary to those of the warrior.

he character of the excellent person is clearer from the sorts of goals he aims at. Achilles and  Agamemnon quarrel, in the incident that begins the main action of the *Iliad*, because Agamemnon takes Briseis, who is  Achilles' prize, and so slights Achilles' honour. Honour (*timé*?), as Homer conceives it, includes, primarily, other people's good opinion, and, secondarily, the material and social 'honours' that are both causes and effects of this good opinion. The hero is individualistic, in so far as he is concerned primarily with his own success and reputation; he does not aim primarily at some collective goal that includes the good of other people, or of a whole society. On the other hand, he is also other-directed, in so far as he must attend to the good opinion of the people who control the goods he aims at. Moreover, as Aristotle remarks, the hero must respect, not merely manipulate their opinion, since it defines the values that make his own aims worth while for him

**iii. Self and others**

We often think a good person is one who treats other people well. In Homeric ethics, similarly, the hero is expected to have some concern for the interests of others; but the nature and limits of his concern for them are not what we might expect.

The hero is certainly not indifferent to others; indeed, much of the action of the Iliad results from the concern of some people for the interests of others. Thetis is concerned about her son

They also care about groups. They care about the army. Trojans care about the city. 

Heros are expected to defend those that depend upon them. 

But being a here is not a prominent part of what makes a hero a heros. Nobody thinks he is not the best of the best because he is indifferent to the Greek. If he had been captured, he would have become less. 

iv Priorities

Secondary status of other people’s interests. 

Instrumental: success depends on co-operation. Hero displays prowess by defending other. These concerns are instrumental to his concern for his own honor. 

Hector could retreat, and he knows Troy will benefit if he does. But he must avoid shame and dishonor, and nobody blames him for putting those above the well-being of the city. 

v. Difficulties in Homeric ethics

1. Very other dependent, i.e., honor requires an honor giver. 
2. All pretty bad for those inferior to the heros. 

vi. Gods and the world 

Homer makes the Gods human like

- they have lots of human emotions, interests, and so on that we can identify with
- Thetis is devoted to her son, Achilles
- We sacrifice to appease the Gods, but they are tempermental and not easily swayed. 
- gods and natural forces

vii. Gods and moral ideals

Gods have recognized honor and status. If angry, they get satisfaction. They feast, taught, and enjoy. they are blessed. 

Humans want this god-like existence of success and enjoyment in the the secure possession of honor and power. 

viii

Zeus and the world order

He shares power with Hades, Poseidon—the three togethe are sons of Cronus

ix Main difficulties in Homer

Homeric hero aims at cleary desirabble goals: success, social status, power, wealth, and honor are inteligible goals and hero aims without apology. No illusion about hazards, but powers on and does not allow obligations to other to interfere with is pursuit of his own interests. 

All this causes conflict because you have battles between heros. Disoder and conflict. A system in which their are winners and losers, conflicts between winners. 

I think it is like today’s focus on education creating leaders. A system that values leadership wins only if their are leaders and followers, so its premised on a world view that cannot equally distribute goods.
