## Introduction

This is a little different this time. Instead of analyzing a piece of text, you will be writing a short paper based on your reading of Epicurus. 

## Prompt 

Pretend that you are Epicurus. You believe that the source of all unhappiness is our fear of death. You have been asked to give a very brief presentation to a group of psychiatry students explaining why you believe this. Write out the speech that you will deliver to these students. 
 
## Further Instruction

+ Write 500-750 words. No more. No less. 
+ Use only 'Hellenistic Philosophy: Introductory Readings' to prepare this assignment. 
+ You are writing a speech, not a research paper. You must write for your audience. Introduce yourself. Thank them for the invitation, etc. I suggest writing in the first person.
