\section*{Introduction}

Epicurus founded a community in Athens called ``the Garden''. Men and
women, free persons, and slaves, were all equally accepted. He claimed that the goal of philosophy was to provide a guide to living
well. In this, he was in agreement with Socrates and Plato. However, he
offered a very different view as to what made a life well lived. According to Epicurus, one should maximize pleasures and minimize pains. You should accept pains that lead to greater pleasures. You should reject pleasures that lead to greater pains. Our entry point will be his views about death. 

\section*{Death}\label{death}

\begin{quote}
``For there is nothing terrible in life for the man who has truly
comprehended that there is nothing terrible in not living.''
 \end{quote}
Epicurus believes that most pain in life comes from fearing death. He asks us to distinguish the pain of death  from the pain of anticipating death. He argues that being dead is not itself painful, and he subsequently argues that we should feel no pain in anticipating death.  Understanding death makes life enjoyable because it takes away the craving for immortality.



\begin{enumerate}
\item Nothing is good or bad for one except sense experience, i.e.~feelings of pleasure and pain. 
\item The dead don't have any sense experiences. 
\item Therefore, nothing is good or bad for the one who is dead. 
\item Therefore, the state of being dead is not (good or) bad for the one who is dead. 
\item If X is not bad for one when it is present, then there is no rational
ground, before it is present, to fear its future presence. 
\item Therefore, no living person has any rational ground to fear his future state of being dead.
\end{enumerate}




\section*{Hedonism}
Our first  premise relies on Epicurus' general account of the good life. 

\begin{quote}
Pleasure is the starting point and goal of living blessedly (\emph{LM} 128).\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
 The removal of all feeling of pain is the limit of the magnitude of pleasures. Wherever a pleasurable feeling is present, for as long as it is present, there is neither a feeling of pain nor a feeling of distress, nor both together (\emph{PD} III).\end{quote}
So, according to Epicurus, happiness is what he calls \emph{ataraxia}, which means, roughly, freedom from disturbance. Epicurus' basic idea is that pleasure consists in the absence of the disturbances and discomfort of desires. Because of the close connection of pleasure with desire-satisfaction, Epicurus devotes a considerable part of his ethics to analyzing
different kinds of desires. If pleasure results from getting what you
want (desire-satisfaction) and pain from not getting what you want
(desire-frustration), then there are two strategies you can pursue with
respect to any given desire: you can either strive to fulfill the
desire, or you can try to eliminate the desire. For the most part
Epicurus advocates the second strategy, that of paring your desires down
to a minimum core, which are then easily satisfied. Epicurus distinguishes between three types of desires:

%There are two ways ataraxia can be achieved, either by satisfying
 %them, or by eliminating them. One can eliminate them by changing them altogether. The approach one takes  will depend on the type of desire. 
 
 %Thus, in order to be happy, one ought to change desires so that one only wants things that are easy to get.


%Epicurus investigates the nature of pleasure and draws some important distinction.  
%\begin{description}
%\item[Static pleasure] consists in the absence of pain, want and desire, e.g., freedom from hunger, thirst. 
%\item[ Kinetic pleasures] always  involves a change in one's psychic state, valuable as a means to  achieving static pleasure (e.g., quenching one's thirst).
%\end{description}

%\item ataraxia consists in static pleasure, understood as the absence of pain (33, 60).
%\item Adaptive conception of happiness: ataraxia achieved by (1) satisfying desires, (2) eliminating them. Thus, in order to be happy, one ought  to change desires so that one only wants things that are easy to get.
 





\begin{enumerate}
\item Natural and necessary desires:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Examples of natural and necessary desires include the desires for
    food, shelter, and the like.
  \item
    These desires are easy to satisfy, difficult to eliminate (they are
    `hard-wired' into human beings naturally), and bring great pleasure
    when satisfied.
  \item
    Furthermore, they are necessary for life, and they are naturally
    limited: that is, if one is hungry, it only takes a limited amount
    of food to fill the stomach, after which the desire is satisfied.
  \item
    Epicurus says that one should try to fulfill these desires.
  \end{itemize}
\item Natural but non-necessary desire:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item An example of a natural but non-necessary desire is the desire for
    luxury food. Although food is needed for survival, one does not need
    a particular type of food to survive.
  \item
    Thus, despite his hedonism, Epicurus advocates a surprisingly
    ascetic way of life. Although one shouldn't spurn extravagant foods
    if they happen to be available, becoming dependent on such goods
    ultimately leads to unhappiness.
  \item
    As Epicurus puts it, ``If you wish to make Pythocles wealthy, don't
    give him more money; rather, reduce his desires.''
  \item
    By eliminating the pain caused by unfulfilled desires, and the
    anxiety that occurs because of the fear that one's desires will not
    be fulfilled in the future, the Epicurean attains tranquility,
    and thus happiness.
  \end{itemize}
\item  Vain and empty desires:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Vain desires include desires for power, wealth, fame, and the like.
  \item
    They are difficult to satisfy, in part because they have no natural
    limit. If one desires wealth or power, no matter how much one gets,
    it is always possible to get more, and the more one gets, the more
    one wants.
  \item
    These desires are not natural to human beings, but they are inculcated by  society and by false beliefs about what we need; e.g., believing
    that having power will bring us security from others.
  \item
    Epicurus thinks that these desires should be eliminated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
