Below are several options for your mid-term paper. **Pick one**. Here are some general guidelines: 

1. Write 750-1000 words. This does not include the bibliography. 
2. Use only the dialogs, my notes, and the resources listed under 'Ancient Philosophy Resources'. 
3. If you paraphrase, quote, or in anyway use material you read elsewhere, then make sure to appropriately cite it and include a bibliography. Please visit the HUB for a citation tutorial if you want instruction in academic citation practices. When citing one of the Platonic texts, use the Stephanus numbers. (See the primer on the website.) 
4. **Great academic writing involves the appropriate use and citation of other work.** It's how you use and cite work that matters. The plagiarism software will detect if you use another's work. I will check how you used it. 
5. The goal is to teach you to explicitly engage with a text. You should be writing things like, 'Socrates says X, Y, and Z. He seems to mean this, that, and the other. Perhaps, though, we could take X to mean something else.' This type of assignment is far more focused on textual analysis than a non-historical philosophy course. When reading your draft ask yourself how much you write explicitly about what Socrates is saying and what your beliefs are on the topic. Much more space should be devoted to Socrates. 

## Due Date - March 13th
You can submit this paper at any point during the semester without penalty. However, if you submit your paper by March 13th at 11:00am, you will receive a 5 point bonus. For instance, if your paper earned a grade of 83 and was submitted on time, it will receive a grade of 88. 

## Option 1

In the *Euthyphro*, Socrates rejects Euthyphro’s proposal that ''the pious is just what I’m doing now: to proceed against whoever does injustice.'' Imagine that you are Socrates. Explain in simple, modern English, the criteria for an adequate answer to a `What is X? question. Then explain why Euthyphro's proposal does not meet these criteria. (You can ignore the explanatory requirement).

### Further Instruction 

+ This assignment asks you to write from Socrates' perspective. What does that mean? On the hand, you should not be writing phrases like 'Socrates thinks', or 'Socrates believes', etc. I'm asking you to imagine that you are Socrates and write as if you were him. Use the firs person pronoun.
+ A reasonable structure to this paper would include one paragraph explaining the first criteria, another the second criteria, the third testing Euythphro's answer agains the first criteria, and the fourth testing his answer against the second criteria. 
+ Use simple examples throughout your paper. 

## Option 2

In the *Meno*, Socrates responds to Meno's paradox of inquiry. Clearly explain that paradox and explain Socrates's solution to it. 

### Further Instruction

+ The paradox of inquiry has two parts, one concerning beginning an inquiry and the other concerning the end of an inquiry. Dedicate a paragraph to each part. Make sure to use examples in your explanations. 
+ Socrates's solution involves the claim that learning is recollection. Don't merely state that. Try relate that theory back to the paradox by explaining how it allows him reject one of the premises in the paradox. 


## Option 3

As clearly and completely as you can, present and critically evaluate Plato’s “Imperfection Argument”, i.e., the argument concerning recollection, for the immortality of the soul at *Phaedo* 72e-78b. What is Plato trying to prove? How successful is the argument?

## Option 4

As clearly and completely as you can, present and critically evaluate Plato’s “Affinity Argument” at *Phaedo* 78b-84b. What is Plato trying to prove? How successful is the argument?
