title: Essay 1
---

Below are several options for your first paper. **Pick one**. Each option includes some extra instruction for that prompt. Here are some general guidelines: 

1. Write 1250-1500 words. This does not include the bibliography. 
2. Use only the dialogs, my notes, and the resources listed under 'Ancient Philosophy Resources'. 
3. If you paraphrase, quote, or in anyway use material you read elsewhere, then make sure to appropriately cite it and include a bibliography. Please visit the HUB for a citation tutorial if you want instruction in academic citation practices. When citing one of the Platonic texts, use the Stephanus numbers. (See the primer on the website.) 
4. **Great academic writing involves the appropriate use and citation of other work.** It's how you use and cite work that matters. The plagiarism software will detect if you use another's work. I will check how you used it. 
4. Submit your paper by Sunday, October, 17th at 11:59pm. 
5. The goal is to teach you to explicitly engage with a text. You should be writing things like, 'Socrates says X, Y, and Z. He seems to mean this, that, and the other. Perhaps, though, we could take X to mean something else.' This type of assignment is far more focused on textual analysis than a non-historical philosophy course. When reading your draft ask yourself how much you write explicitly about what Socrates is saying and what your beliefs are on the topic. Much more space should be devoted to Socrates. 


## Option 1

In the *Euthyphro*, Socrates rejects Euthyphro’s proposal that ''the pious is just what I’m doing now: to proceed against whoever does injustice.'' Imagine that you are Socrates. Explain in simple, modern English, the criteria for an adequate answer to a `What is X? question. Then explain why Euthyphro's proposal does not meet these criteria. (You can ignore the explanatory requirement).

### Further Instruction 

+ This assignment asks you to write from Socrates' perspective. What does that mean? On the hand, you should not be writing phrases like 'Socrates thinks', or 'Socrates believes', etc. I'm asking you to imagine that you are Socrates and write as if you were him. Use the firs person pronoun.
+ A reasonable structure to this paper would include one paragraph explaining the first criteria, another the second criteria, the third testing Euythphro's answer agains the first criteria, and the fourth testing his answer against the second criteria. 
+ Use simple examples throughout your paper. 

## Option 2

In the *Meno*, Socrates responds to Meno's paradox of inquiry. Clearly explain that paradox and explain Socrates's solution to it. 

### Further Instruction

+ The paradox of inquiry has two parts, one concerning beginning an inquiry and the other concerning the end of an inquiry. Dedicate a paragraph to each part. Make sure to use examples in your explanations. 
+ Socrates's solution involves the claim that learning is recollection. Don't merely state that. Try relate that theory back to the paradox by explaining how it allows him reject one of the premises in the paradox. 


## Option 3

In the *Theaetetus*, Socrates uses Protagoras's measure doctrine to help support Theaetetus's proposal that knowledge is perception. How does the former support the latter? That is, why would accepting the measure doctrine provide you the resources to claim that knowledge is perception? 

### Further Instruction
+ Make sure to explain the various marks of knowledge, e.g., that knowledge is unerring and always of what is. Then try break down the parts of the measure doctrine and show how, if you adopt it, it is easy to see how perception might be both unerring and of what is. 

## Option 4

In the *Protagoras*, Socrates argues for what is called the unity of the virtues. What does he mean by this claim, and how does he argue for it? 


### Further Instruction


## Option 5

In the *Apology*, Socrates defends himself against a number of charges. Clearly outline these charges, then discuss, in detail, how he defends himself against *one* of them. 

### Further Instruction 

+ Make sure to complete both parts of this assignment. One part should explain the charges against Socrates. The second should explain Socrates' defense against one and only one of these charges. 
+ A reasonable structure would consist of one paragraph for each of the charges and then a structured discussion of his response to  whichever one you pick..

## Option 6

In the *Crito*, Socrates argues that it would be wrong for him to escape jail. His argument is a general argument against civil disobedience. Suppose the Governor's vaccine mandate applies to you and that this mandate is lawful. Write a letter to some anti-vaccine friend using Socrates' arguments to show that it would be unjust for you to go unvaccinated. Make sure to explicitly compare your argument to Socrates's, i.e., explain how Socrates argument that it is unjust to escape prison is similar to your own. 

### Further Instruction

+ Students picking this prompt should writing a paper too removed from the *Crito*. This paper is about the *Crito*, and you must be fully engaged with the text. This paper, however, is giving you the opportunity to consider how the argument in the *Crito* applies to a debate about the vaccine mandate. Just make sure you write more about the *Crito* than you do about vaccines. #
