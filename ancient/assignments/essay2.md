title: Essay 2
---

Below are several options for your second paper. **Pick one**. Each option includes some extra instruction for that prompt. Here are some general guidelines: 

1. Write 1250-1500 words. This does not include the bibliography. 
2. Use only the dialogs, my notes, and the resources listed under 'Ancient Philosophy Resources'. 
3. If you paraphrase, quote, or in anyway use material you read elsewhere, then make sure to appropriately cite it and include a bibliography. Please visit the HUB for a citation tutorial if you want instruction in academic citation practices. When citing one of the Platonic texts, use the Stephanus numbers. (See the primer on the website.) 
4. **Great academic writing involves the appropriate use and citation of other work.** It's how you use and cite work that matters. The plagiarism software will detect if you use another's work. I will check how you used it. 
4. Submit your paper by Sunday, November, 21st at 11:59pm. 
5. The goal is to teach you to explicitly engage with a text. You should be writing things like, 'Socrates says X, Y, and Z. He seems to mean this, that, and the other. Perhaps, though, we could take X to mean something else.' This type of assignment is far more focused on textual analysis than a non-historical philosophy course. When reading your draft ask yourself how much you write explicitly about what Socrates is saying and what your beliefs are on the topic. Much more space should be devoted to Socrates. 


## Option 1

As clearly and completely as you can, present and critically evaluate Plato’s “Imperfection Argument”, i.e., the argument concerning recollection, for the immortality of the soul at *Phaedo* 72e-78b. What is Plato trying to prove? How successful is the argument?

## Option 2

As clearly and completely as you can, present and critically evaluate Plato’s “Affinity Argument” at *Phaedo* 78b-84b. What is Plato trying to prove? How successful is the argument?


## Option 3

As clearly and completely as you can, explain how Glaucon attempts to argue in *Republic* BK 2 that justice is something we desire **only** for its consequences. 

## Option 4

As clearly and completely as you can, explain Socrates' account of  how the best city is just, moderate, courageous, and wise. Do you agree? Give reasons for your answers. 

## Option 5

As clearly and completely as you can, explain the way that a just soul is meant to be analogous to just city. Describe one way the analogy might break down.  

## Option 6

As clearly and completely as you can, explain how Socrates argues that the city arranged in the way he has hypothetically created it is better than all other types of cities.
