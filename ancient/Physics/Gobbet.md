Pay special attention to *Physics* Book 2, ch.1-3 & 7-9. For each passage, write a very short paragraph on *context*, *content*, and *assessment*.



**Passage 1**

All the causes just mentioned are of four especially evident types: (l) Letters are the cause of syllables, matter of artifacts, fire and such things of bodies, parts of the whole, and the assumptions of the conclusion, as that out of which. In each of these cases one thing-for instance, the parts-is cause as subject, while (2) the other thing-the whole, the composition, and the form-is cause as essence. (3) The seed, the doctor, the adviser and, in general, the producer, are all sources of the principle of change or stability. (4) In other cases, one thing is a cause of other things by being the end and the good. For what the other things are for is taken to be the best and their end-it does not matter whether we call it the good or the apparent good (195a16).

**Passage 2**

Why not suppose, then, that the same is true of the parts of natural organisms? On this view, it is of necessity that, for example, the front teeth grow sharp and well adapted for biting, and the back ones broad and useful for chewing food; this (useful) result was coincidental, not what they were for. The same will be true of all the other parts that seem to be for something. On this view, then, whenever all the parts came about coincidentally as though they were for something, these animals survived, since their constitution, though coming about by chance, made them suitable (for survival) (198b23).
