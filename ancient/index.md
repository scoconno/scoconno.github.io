## Additional materials and notes

The syllabus details our schedule of readings from the course texts. **Consult the syllabus first and read whatever is assigned there first.** I include here additional readings that you might find useful, occasional videos & podcasts, and notes. I normally edit and improve my notes each time I offer this course, so please take the posted notes as tentative. **All assignments can be found in Blackboard.**
