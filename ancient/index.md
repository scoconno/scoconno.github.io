## Course Information

Welcome to the course website for *Ancient Philosophy*.  There are two sections of this course, HON 360 for the honors program and PHIL 234 for the philosophy department. The two sections overlap, but differ significantly. Please click on the syllabus for the section for which you are enrolled: 

+ [HON 360 Syllabus](Syllabus.pdf)
+ [PHIL 234 Syllabus](SyllabusM.pdf)
+ [Ancient Philosophy Resources](resources)
+ [How to answer Gobbets](Guide.pdf)



## Additional materials and notes

The syllabus details our schedule of readings from the course texts. I include here additional readings that you might find useful, occassional videos & podcasts, and notes. I normally post the notes only after the deadline for the reading questions/gobbets has passed. 

Week 1: Introduction
+ [Notes](Introduction/Lecture 1.pdf)

Week 2: The *Euthyphro*
+ [*Euthyphro* ](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html). If you have yet to purchase the textbook, you can print the dialog from the linked website. You must have a copy of the reading in class with you. The textbooks are required from week 3.
