The passages below are taken from *De Anima*. Please analyze both. For each, write a very short paragraph on *context*, *content*, and *assessment*.



**Passage 1**

We were saying, then, that the affections of the soul (for instance, emotion and fear) are, insofar as they are affections of the soul, inseparable (unlike surface and line) from the natural matter of animals (403b18).

**Passage 2**


The soul is evidently also a cause by being what something is for. For just as productive thought aims at something, so does nature, and what it aims at is its end. In living things the natural end is the soul; for all natural bodies, of plants no less than of animals, are organs of the soul, since they are for the sake of the soul (415b15).
