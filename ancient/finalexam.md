Explain in simple, modern English, one criterion for an adequate answer to a `What is X? question. Then explain why Euthyphro's proposal does not satisfy this criterion.

3. After declaring the ideal city established, Socrates turns to locate the four virtues---wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice---in it (427d-434d).
