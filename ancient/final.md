## Prompts

**(1)** Why was Socrates brought to trial? How, and how well, does he defend himself in the *Apology* against the charges? What does his defense reveal about his philosophical views and aims? 

**(2)**  In the *Apology* Socrates refuses to obey any law or other order by the state that would require him to give up philosophical activity. But in the *Crito* he seems to argue that disobedience to the law is always wrong. What are his arguments for these claims in the two dialogs? Do *Apology* and *Crito* show that he is inconsistent in his theory?


**(3)** What is Plato’s doctrine of Recollection? How does he try (in the *Meno*) to establish the doctrine? How successful is he in establishing it?

**(4)** What is “Meno’s paradox” (*Meno* 80d-e) supposed to prove? Does it succeed in proving its conclusion? Expound and evaluate Socrates’ response to it.

**(5)** Present, as clearly and completely as you can, and critically evaluate, Plato’s “Imperfection Argument” at *Phaedo* 73-76. What is Plato trying to prove? How successful is the argument?

**(6)** How, and how well, does Plato argue for the immortality of the soul in *Phaedo*? How does he conceive of the soul, and of its relation to the body?

**(7)** What is Plato's account of justice in *Republic*. How plausible is it? 

**(8)** In the *Physics*, Aristotle introduces the notions of form and matter. Why does he introduce them?  Are his reasons good ones?

**(9)** Explain Aristotle’s doctrine (*Physics* II) of the four causes. Explain why Aristotle thinks that natural objects, as well as artifacts, have final causes. Are his reasons for positing final causes good ones? 

**(10)** What is Aristotle's theory of soul in *De Anima* II, 1-3. What is a soul, according to Aristotle? What problems do you see with this view? 

**(11)** How does Aristotle's conception of the soul compare to Plato’s in the *Phaedo*? Which theory seems more plausible to you, and why?

**(12)** Explain and critically evaluate Aristotle's functional argument in *Nicomachean Ethics* I.7. 

**(13)** Compare and contrast the Stoic and Epicurean understanding of happiness.
