\section{Approved Substitution}

This course substitutes for PHIL 234: Ancient Philosophy. As such, it satisfies a major requirement for the Philosophy, B.A., and an elective in the Philosophy and Religion minor. If you would like to avail of this substitution, you must discuss it with me. It might also be used as an elective by History students. 

\section{Disclaimer}
 This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the faculty. Students will be notified of such changes ahead of time via Blackboard. 


\section{Copyright}
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lectures, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any unauthorized copying of the class materials or recording of lectures is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. 

\section{Course Description}

What do you know? Do you know anything? What exists? Are there objective truths about whatâ€™s right and wrong for you to do, or is it all a matter of convention? Does being a moral person go against your self-interest? If so, why should you be a moral person? What is happiness? Will being a moral person contribute to your happiness? These questions were raised by philosophers speaking and writing in Greek over two millennia ago. In this course, we will think hard about these questions and try to identify how they were answered by three of the most influential philosophers of all time---Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. 

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course students will be able to (i) read philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv) write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of the philosophies of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
