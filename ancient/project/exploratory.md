## Introduction

Independent research is a central characteristic of an honors education. So, in this course, you will learn and practice research skills. To that end, you will work on an independent project through the semester. We will scaffold that project around a few basic skills and tasks to practice those skills (see syllabus for assignment due dates).

1. A manageable and interesting research question and agenda (two parts due at different times).
	1. Submit an exploratory essay with a short list of potential list of background sources. 
	2. Submit a well sculpted question and final annotated bibliography of 3--5 sources.  
2. Submit a first draft. This will consist primarily of a literature review. 
3. Deliver an oral presentation.
4. Submit a final draft of your paper. This will be 2000-2500 words excluding headings, footnotes, and list of citations used. 

**Medium:** Upon meeting with me and developing an agreed upon plan, you may use an alternative medium to the final research paper, e.g., documentary, art project, etc. Any alternative plan  still requires you to complete 1 and modified versions of 2--4. 

## Research Question and Agenda
This part of the project consists of two parts, each submitted at different times. See the syllabus for deadlines. I provide instructions to Part 1 here.

### Part 1: Exploratory essay and agenda. 

This first assignment has three tasks

1. Indicate the **one** text by Plato or Aristotle and the **one topic in that text** you will research. If the text is not included in the reader, you must talk to me in advance in order to work on it.   
2. Write 500-750 words on background information to your topic and test.
3. Write the citations for 5 **academic written sources** that deal with your topic. 

I provide further information on each task. 

## Task 1
The first task asks you to identify the text and general topic you wish to research. To do this, read the short paragraphs at the beginning of each work in the reader. If one seems interesting to you, then skim the work and see whether you might want to spend a semester working on it. At this stage, your interest will be very broad and perhaps confused. That's fine. Research starts in this confused way, and it gets clearer as we progress. Note that you must pick a text by Plato or Aristotle. 

While you must pick how one text treats an issue, you can explore related Greek historical, political, cultural, artistic, religious, scientific, etc., issues as they pertain to that text. For instance, you might focus merely on a text in this way, "I will research the different theories of love in the *Symposium*". But you might instead focus on how those views relate to Greek views at that time, e.g., "I will research which of the theories of love in the *Symposium* were closest to ordinary Greek views at the time." 

Do not expect to identify an interesting research project before reading through the short descriptions in the reader. 

## Task 2

The second task asks you to provide context and background to your topic. This context provides enough detail to explain why your topic is something that requires further research and study. Suppose you encounter this question: 

+ Does Socrates claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Suppose further you have never heard of Socrates. You would be so unanchored that you wouldn't even know the relevant area the question concerned. You definitely wouldn't know enough to care about answering that question. Now suppose that the author prefaced their question with the following: 

> Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher, is famous for claiming in the *Apology* that he is wise because he does not take himself to know what he does not know. But he doesn't explain what wisdom amounts to. The very little he says seems to leave open the possibility that a person who knew nothing at all could be wise. As long as they didn't claim to have knowledge, they would be wise. But lots of thing satisfy this description. My cat does. She doesn't claim to have knowledge. Does that make her wise? It does from a simple reading of Socrates' claim. 
>
> So, we want to take a closer look at Socrates' account of wisdom. Perhaps he believes that the wise person is not merely silent about their lack of knowledge but is also aware of that lack. That kind of awareness is not something my cat possesses. But if this isn't the relevant addition, is there anything else to Socrates' account of wisdom that would avoid the conclusion that my cat is wise? 


When we provide our readers sufficient context like this, they understand what we want to write about, and they often want to read what we have to say. So, for this assignment, you will write some context and background for your topic. My example here is quite short, but you need to write 500--750 words. To fill out the exploration, you could, in this instance, discuss the context in which Socrates' disavows knowledge but asserts wisdom, or you could read some scholarly literature and sketch how others interpret it. If your topic was more historical, on say how Plato's ideal state in the *Republic* compares to Sparta's militaristic society, you could provide background research on Sparta. There are various forms your exploration could take depending on your particular interests. But the exploration must be *research focused*. Do not tell me you want to research a topic because you have always wondered about something, or because you once experienced something, or you once saw something. That's not research. 


## Task 3

Research projects require, well, research! You need to read what other researchers have to say about your topic. Before you can do that, you need to find the research. In this part of the assignment, you must submit the full citations for 5 sources, but this assignment is not asking you to read these sources. It is asking you to identify and collect sources that you can use as you start your research. Note the following: 

1. These are sources that you must have access to. 
3. Wikipedia, youtube, quora, youtube transcripts, your hunches, etc., are not academic sources. The written sources must be either articles that are published in peer reviewed scholarly journals or books published by scholarly presses. 
4. An entire section of the library, and several librarians, are entirely focused to helping users find material for their research. Details [here](https://www.njcu.edu/library/about-library/library-departments/reference-department).
