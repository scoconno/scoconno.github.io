title: Question and annotated bibliography

## Research project part 2

In this part of the assignment, you will do two distinct things: 

1. Submit a clearly articulated properly formed and manageable question. 
2. Submit an annotated bibliography for five academic sources


I will give further guidance below. 



### ### Tasks 1:  the question



In your exploratory essay, you indicated the general area you wished to research. You now need to state a precise and well-formed manageable question about that general area. 

By **well-formed**, I mean that you must submit a question  **question**. Questions are formed with an interrogative. Here are a few examples: 

+ *which*, *what*
+ *how*
+ *why*
+ *who*, *whom*, *whose* 
+ *when*
+ *when*
+ *does*

So *what* question would you like to answer?

By **manageable**, I mean that your question must be one that is sufficiently narrow to be completed by the end of the semester. Compare the following two questions:

1. What does Socrates think about wisdom? 
2. Does Socrates in the *Apology* claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Our first question would require you to examine each work that concerns Socrates and wisdom. It's a great project. But it would take an entire book to  complete it successfully. The second question is manageable and could be completed in a couple of months. It requires you to only focus on the *Apology* and the secondary literature about this work. It also doesn't require a full discussion of everything that Socrates has to say about wisdom, but it requires that you say enough to answer the question. 

Let's take a second example:

1. How does Plato prove in *Republic* that it is always in our interest to be just?   
2. Is Plato correct in *Republic* Book 8 that democracy inevitably leads to tyranny? 

Here is a second example: 

1. Why did Aristotle believe that organisms are composed of both form and matter? 
1. How does Aristotle's argument in *Physics* Book 2 that material necessity alone cannot explain why teeth grow as they do support his claim that organisms are composed of both form and matter?

Our first question is a beast! In one way or another, I've spent most of my adult life thinking and writing about it. I mean it. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on a small part of that project. My masters and doctorate both focused on other parts of the project. It'll occupy me for at least another ten years. In part, the first question is so tough because there are so many texts and so much secondary literature to consider. The second question, however, is focused on one part of one text. It asks a very circumscribed question that you could write an informed piece about over the next few months. 

Finally, how about this: 

1. How does Plato's views of education compare to contemporary views of education? 
1. Is Plato's claim in *Republic* Book 2 that children should only be educated about perfect depictions about the gods compatible with treatments of religion in the curriculum at Jersey City public schools?

I hope it's obvious how these two differ!


## Task 2: annotated bibliography

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and
documents. Each citation is followed by a brief descriptive paragraph,
the annotation. The purpose of the annotation is to create and collect a
small number of documents that you can use to write your large research
paper. We will focus on three types of resources:

The primary text:

:   this is your chosen work, whether it is a particular book of Plato's
    *Republic*, the *Symposium*, etc. If the work is divided into books,
    like Plato's *Republic*, you will likely only focus on a specific
    book.

Background sources:

:   these include encyclopedia entries and textbooks. Such resources do
    not argue for any particular view. They explain a text and often
    summarize the main interpretative disputes about a text. The
    Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Internet Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy are excellent. They are available online and will have
    suggestions for other readings.

Secondary literature:

:   these include academic research about your chosen text. Very little
    is agreed upon and the secondary literature is where academics argue
    for one interpretation over the other. These come in the form of
    papers published in peer review journals and books published by
    academic presses. Papers run normally about 30 pages. While books
    are obviously longer, you normally will be able to focus on one or
    two chapters for your project.

The Process {#header-n16 .unnumbered}
-----------

Creating an annotated bibliography calls for the application of a
variety of intellectual skills: concise exposition, succinct analysis,
and informed library research.

1.  Locate and record citations to books, periodicals, and documents
    that may contain useful information and ideas on your topic. While
    you can use the library website, you should also go into the
    library. If you locate a book you think is useful, look at the rest
    of the shelf. Often you will find other relevant material.

    -   **NB:** Use librarians! One of the main jobs of an academic
        librarian is to help users find research material. Tell them
        what you are interested in and they will help you figure out
        what to read.

    -   Digital resources are risky. There is as much false information
        online as there is accurate information. If you do use online
        resources, try only to use resources found through the library's
        website.

    -   A good place to start is the list of resources under 'Ancient
        Resources' on the course website.

2.  Briefly examine and review the actual items. While you only need to
    skim these sources, you need to read them closely enough to decide
    whether they are relevant.

3.  Choose those works that are relevant and helpful for your topic.
    Discard those that are irrelevant.

4.  Of those you keep, cite the book, article, or document using the
    your preferred citation style, e.g., APA, Chicago, etc. Make sure to
    note the translator of any Greek texts.

5.  Write a concise annotation that summarizes the central theme and
    scope of the work. For the primary text, identify the main
    claim/question that interests you and write a very short summary of
    the work, where your summary picks up on whatever is relevant for
    your topic. Think here of the context from the gobbets. For the
    other types of sources, explain how they relate to your question. If
    they contain an answer, or a variety of answer, clearly state those
    answers. You may also compare or contrast the various works you have
    cited, e.g., work A defends answer X, but work B rejects answer X
    and argues for answer Y.

Requirements {#header-n55 .unnumbered}
------------

-   Your annotated bibliography must include **annotations** for your
    **one** primary text, **one** background source, and **two**
    secondary literature sources. Word limits (keep it short!):

    -   Primary text: 250-500 words.

    -   Background source: 150-250 words.

    -   Secondary literature 1: 150-250 words.

    -   Secondary literature 2: 150-250 words.

-   Your annotated bibliography must include **citations** for i) your
    primary text, ii) at least **two** background sources, i.e.,
    encyclopedias and textbooks, and (iii) at least **five** secondary
    literature sources, whether they be articles from scholarly journals
    or books published by academic publishers.

-   **NB: You are being asked to collect and cite several sources that
    discuss your topic, but I am asking you to summarize just a few of
    these sources. I encourage you to complete the annotations for the
    rest of the citations before you write your paper, but that is not a
    requirement for this assignment.**

-   Grading: this is worth 7 points towards your final grade in the
    course. (The proposed question was worth 3. The literature review,
    presentation, and final paper will be worth a total of 30.)
