## Introduction

I want honors students to identify topics that interest them and be able to independently inquire into those topics well after their classes with me. So, in an honors course, I try to develop the traits needed to become independent researchers. This course is no different. You will complete an independent project over the remainder of the semester.  But we will scaffold that project around a few basic skills (and tasks to practice those skills).

1. Identify and propose a manageable and interesting research question.
2. Write a annotated bibliography.
3. Deliver an oral presentation.
4. Submit a draft of your research paper. 
5. Submit a polished and improved version of that paper. 



## Research Question 



### The form of a question

In our first stage, you will clearly articulate some question you wish to answer this semester. And I mean **question**. Questions are formed with an interrogative. Here are a few examples: 

+ *which*, *what*
+ *how*
+ *why*
+ *who*, *whom*, *whose* 
+ *when*
+ *when*
+ *does*

So *what* question would you like to answer this semester? 

###A manageable question

Research projects vary in scope and ambition. Some ask narrowly defined questions and can be completed in a few months. Others ask large questions that take years to address. Your question must fall in the former category. So, compare the following two questions:

1. What does Socrates think about wisdom? 
2. Does Socrates in the *Apology* claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Our first question would require you to examine each work that concerns Socrates and wisdom. It would require you to also give a full characterization of pretty much everything he thinks about wisdom. It's a great project. But it's a huge project. It would take an entire book to  complete it successfully. The second question is manageable and could be completed in a couple of months. It requires you to only focus on the *Apology* and the secondary literature about this work. It also doesn't require a full discussion of everything that Socrates has to say about wisdom, but it requires that you say enough to answer the question. 

Let's take a second example:

1. How does Plato prove in *Republic* that it is always in our interest to be just?   
2. Is Plato correct in*Republic* Book 8 that democracy inevitably leads to tyranny? 

Our first question requires an entire treatment of the *Republic*, a work of about 10 books. (We'll see that the entire work is meant to prove that it always benefits us to be just.) Completing the project would require you to read countless articles and books. It would even require you to write your very own book. But the second question is very manageable. Plato makes the argument in one small part of *Republic* as part of his overall investigation of justice. So, you wouldn't need to examine all 10 books of the work. You would need to examine just a part of one book. Here's a third example: 

1. Why did Aristotle believe that organisms are composed of both form and matter? 
1. How does Aristotle's argument in *Physics* Book 2 that material necessity alone cannot explain why teeth grow as they do support his claim that organisms are composed of both form and matter?

Our first question is a beast! In one way or another, I've spent most of my adult life thinking and writing about it. I mean it. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on a small part of that project. My masters and doctorate both focused on other parts of the project. It'll occupy me for at least another 10 years. In part, the first question is so tough because there are so many texts and so much secondary literature to consider. The second question, however, is focused on one part of one text. It asks a very circumscribed question that you could write an informed piece about over the next few months. 

Finally, how about this: 

1. How does Plato's views of education compare to contemporary views of education? 
1. Is Plato's claim in *Republic* Book 2 that children should only be educated about perfect depictions about the gods compatible with treatments of religion in the curriculum at Jersey City public schools?

I hope it's obvious how these two differ!


## Task

I am helping you narrow your interests by requiring you to a) focus on just one author, either Aristotle or Plato/Socrates, and b) focus on just one of their texts. You may wish to focus only on the works in the reader for the class. If your topic is in a text not included in the reader, e.g., Aristotle's  *Poetics*, you can write about that too. You need to complete the following **four tasks**: 

1. State your question. You must use an interrogative. I also expect to see a question mark. 
1. Identify the one author you will focus on.
1. Identify the one text that you will focus on (and ideally some part of that text)
1. Write a short paragraph that motivates your question.

The final task might confuse you, so let me explain it further. The idea is that you want to provide some context just like you have been doing in the gobbets. The context provides just a few details to your reader to help them see why your question is an interesting one. Or to put it differently, it provides enough detail to explain why your question does not have an obvious answer and is something that requires further research and study. Suppose you write on this question: 

+ Does Socrates in the *Apology* claim that a person can be wise if they know nothing whatsoever? 

Your short paragraph might be this: 

> Socrates claims that he is wise insofar as he does not take himself to know what he does not know. He does, not, however give a full account about wisdom amounts to. The very little he says seems to leave open the possibility that a person who knew nothing at all could be wise. As long as they didn't claim to have knowledge, they would be wise. But lots of people and things satisfy this description. My cat does. So does my couch. Perhaps a coma patient does too. So, something seems missing from Socrates' account of wisdom. Perhaps the wise person not only is aware of the knowledge they do not possess, but they also have the capacity and desire to obtain knowledge. So, we might ask whether Socrates thinks that wisdom also requires that you possess some knowledge (of which you are correctly aware that you have). And, if he doesn't, is there anything else to his account of wisdom that would avoid the conclusion that my cat is wise?
