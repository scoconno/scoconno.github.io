title: Literature Review

## Overview
We now need to study the sources in our annotated bibliography, and write a literature review based upon that work. That is, we must complete a literature review. Your literature review will include three sections and a bibliography. I include full clarification below, but here is a summary of this assignment: 

+ Section 1 provides all the relevant background and raises your research question. This must be **250-500 words total.** Provide an informative but short section title. 
+ Section 2 explains one answer from a representative resource defending that answer. This must be **500-750 words total.** Provide an informative but short section title. 
+ Section 3 explains a different answer from a representative resource defending that answer. This must be **500-750 words total**. Provide an informative but short section title. 
+ Section 4 provides your bibliography.

**Failure to include any of these sections will result in loss of points.** 

This structure is artificial. Many questions admit of more than two answers. Many similar answers have subtle differences. That's ok! If you can identify and explain two different mains answers to your question, then you will have learned the skill this assignment is designed to teach. 




## What is a literature Review? 

You have decided on a question. You have identified some articles and books that seem relevant to your question and written annotations. Now what? Look at the bibliography at the end of any scholarly paper or the back of any book. The bibliography likely amounts to hundreds if not thousands of pages of work. But the author didn't write in detail about all of this work. What gives?  The purpose of this assignment is to teach you what to do with all the material you have collected. What's it for? What should you include? How much work do you really have to do on it all? That means---literature review time!  

Your job in writing a literature review is to identify relevant similarities and dissimilarities in the various sources that seem to address your topic. You will regularly find that different parts of the literature take opposing sides on your question. Here we have an important trend that you want to mention. You will also find common or dominant reasons for various answers. Again, this is something you want to note and write about. 

What about all the nitty gritty details? Your job is to extrapolate from the details and report on common approaches, criticisms, objections, etc. That's doesn't mean that no detail is required. Literature reviews often include a discussion of some representative source. A literature review may note that a common approach in the literature is to consider X when answering Y, and then say, "for instance, "author A write as following....Author A means...., which captures a dominant answer in the literature."

So, literature reviews will both explain some of the current, common views about a topic *and* discuss a couple of sources to illustrate these common features/trends. 

## Assignment Structure

### Section 1: Shared context, question, solution

We have already practiced this in your exploratory essays, but we now want to be far more targeted.

Suppose you pick up a paper and it begins 'Students choose college based on either cost alone or reputation alone.' That's a bit abrupt. The author does not explain why it's important to identify why students pick college over another, nor do they explain why anyone would be interested in reading about the issue. Now consider this opening: 

> New Jersey's high schools are full and getting fuller. We are graduating more and more of these students too. Not only that, more and more of our graduates are going on to attend college. So, New Jersey seems to be doing well by its young folk. Unfortunately, though, this good news is tempered by a worrying trend. Fewer and fewer or our students are attending college in New Jersey itself. Our young people are leaving in great numbers to attend colleges and universities in other states. This bodes poorly for the future. It's unclear that they will return to benefit the state they left. Why is this happening? Why are young people choosing to attend college out of state? There are two opposing views. One group of researchers argue that cost alone is the culprit. They claim that our young people are leaving because colleges and universities in other states are cheaper. Not everyone agrees. A different group of researchers blame the exodus on students' belief in the respective qualities of in-state and out of state colleges. The researchers offer very different remedies to the proposal. If the former is correct, then we should focus on lowering tuition in the Garden State. If the latter is correct, we need to do a better job at marketing the strengths and successes of our state institutions. 

Notice that this introduction does three things. Do each of these three things in the first section of your literature review too: 

1. It **establishes a shared context**, i.e., it informs the reader about some phenomenon. 
2. It asks a **research question** about that shared context. 
3. It **clearly and quickly states some answers** that will subsequently be explained later in the paper. 




### Section 2: Answer 1 - Include a short informative title

Here you will explain one way your question is answered in the literature. Your job here is to summarize the answer given and also the main reasons offered for that answer. You will also write a few paragraphs summarizing some details from a representative work that answers your question in this way. 



### Section 3: Answer 2 - Include a short informative title 

Here you will explain a different way that your question is answered in the literature. Your job here is to summarize the answer given and also the main reasons offered for that answer. You will also write a coupe of paragraphs summarizing some details from a representative work that answers your question in this way.

### Section 4: Bibliography

The list of citations. Do not include the annotations here; the annotations are your notes that you will help you in writing the literature review. 





## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

## Format
Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.
