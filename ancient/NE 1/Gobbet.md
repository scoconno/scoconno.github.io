## Nicomachean Ethics, Book 1.1-8, Book 2.1-6 

You should read the following chapters very carefully. All other can be skimmed: 

1. Book 1, ch.1-2
2. Book 1, ch.7
3. Book 2, ch.1-4

There are three passages. You must analyze each. Your analysis must include a short paragraph each for context, content, and assessment. 

**Passage 1**

Suppose, then, that (a) there is some end of the things we pursue in our actions which we wish for because of itself, and because of which we wish for the other things; and (b) we do not choose everything because of something else, since (c) if we do, it will go on without limit, making desire empty and futile; then clearly (d) this end will be the good, i.e. the best good (1094a18).


**Passage 2**

Happiness, then, is apparently something complete and self-sufficient, since it is the end of the things pursued in action (1097b22).

 

**Passage 3**

It is the same, then, with the virtues. For actions in dealings with (other) human beings make some people just, some unjust; actions in terrifying situations and the acquired habit of fear or confidence make some brave and others cowardly. The same is true of situations involving appetites and anger; for one or another sort of conduct in these situations makes some people temperate and gentle, others intemperate and irascible (1103b14).
