These two passages are from *Apology*. Please complete both and submit through the relevant link on Blackboard. 

**Passage 1**

For my part, I thought to myself as I left, “I’m wiser than that person. For it’s likely that neither of us knows anything fine and good, but he thinks he knows something he doesn’t know, whereas I, since I don’t in fact know, don’t think that I do either. At any rate, it seems that I’m wiser than he in just this one small way: that what I don’t know, I don’t think I know” (21d).

**Passage 2**

What’s that, Meletus? Are you so much wiser at your age than I at mine, that you know bad people do something bad to whoever’s closest to them at the given moment, and good people something good? Am I, by contrast, so very ignorant that I don’t know even this: that if I do something bad to an associate, I risk getting back something bad from him in return? And is the result, as you claim, that I do so very bad a thing intentionally? (25d-e).
