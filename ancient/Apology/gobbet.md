There are three passages this week. They are from *Apology*. Please complete **all three** and submit through the relevant link on Blackboard. Please also read the excerpt from Aristophanes, *Clouds*

**Passage 1**

For my part, I thought to myself as I left, “I’m wiser than that person. For it’s likely that neither of us knows anything fine and good, but he thinks he knows something he doesn’t know, whereas I, since I don’t in fact know, don’t think that I do either. At any rate, it seems that I’m wiser than he in just this one small way: that what I don’t know, I don’t think I know.” (21d).

**Passage 2**

What’s that, Meletus? Are you so much wiser at your age than I at mine, that you know bad people do something bad to whoever’s closest to them at the given moment, and good people something good? Am I, by contrast, so very ignorant that I don’t know even this: that if I do something bad to an associate, I risk getting back something bad from him in return? And is the result, as you claim, that I do so very bad a thing intentionally? (25d-e)

**Passage 3**

But again, if I say it’s the greatest good for a man to discuss virtue every day, and the other things you’ve heard me discussing and examining myself and others about, on the grounds that the unexamined life isn’t worth living for a human being, you’ll believe me even less when I say that (38a).
