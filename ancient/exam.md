## Final Exam

Your final exam will include two parts: 

1. 20 multiple choice questions. These are questions already asked via Blackboard. 
2. Two short essays, one on Plato and one on Aristotle. These should be c.500 words long. All options below will appear on the paper. Study and prepare for these in advance of the exam. 

**Please bring paper to the final exam**

### Plato

*Pick one*

**(1)** As clearly and completely as you can, explain the way that a just soul is meant to be analogous to just city in Plato's *Republic*. Describe one way the analogy might break down.  

**(2)** As clearly and completely as you can, explain how Socrates in the *Republic* argues that the city arranged in the way he has hypothetically created it is better than all other types of cities. 

### Aristotle

*Pick one*

**(1)** Explain Aristotle’s doctrine (*Physics* II) of the four causes. Explain why Aristotle thinks that natural objects, as well as artifacts, have final causes. Are his reasons for positing final causes good ones?
