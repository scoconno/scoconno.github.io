"Piety is doing as I am doing; that is to say, prosecuting any one who is guilty of murder, sacrilege, or of any similar crime-whether he be your father or mother, or whoever he may be-that makes no difference; and not to prosecute them is impiety."

**Context**

This passage occurs in Euthyphro's first attempt to explain the nature of piety; Euthyphro claims to be an expert about piety and religious matters more generally, and so takes himself to be a reliable judge about what actions are pious and impious. Socrates tests Euthphyrho's supposed expertise by asking him what piety is.

**Content**

Euthyphro's first attempt consists in listing several examples of piety: it is pious to prosecute those guilty of murder or other offenses. He is adamant that not prosecuting those guilty of such a crime is, itself, impious. This suggests that he thinks we have a religious obligation to prosecute those guilty of such crimes. He thinks that this duty is not premised on our relationship to the accused, and, presumably, on whether the person is rich, poor, powerful, or powerless. He says we should prosecute 'any one who is guilty of muder'.

**Assessment**

Socrates will object that Euthyphro does not explain why each pious act is pious; he only provides examples of pious actions. But he misses another mistake: Euthyhphro claims not only that it is pious to prosecute the wrong-doer, but also that it is impious not to do so. But just because it is pious to do X, it does not follow that it is impious to not do X. In general, failing to perform a moral action does not always entail that you have performed an immoral action. Socrates is silent on this point, so we might ask whether he thinks that failure to perform a moral act does, in fact, entail that one acts immorally.

Why do Socrates and Euthyphro reject the definition of piety as "what all the gods love" (starting at 9d)?  What assumptions do they make?
Does Socrates reject the definition of piety as "what all the gods love" because there are pious actions that not all the gods love, because there are non-pious actions that not all the gods love, or for neither reason?
