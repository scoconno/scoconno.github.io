## Mock Trial of Socrates

## The Teams

| Prosecution     | Defense |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Stefania (captain)      | Cesar (captain)      |
| Neida  		| Tony       |
| Diranlly 		| Nisrine        |
| Jessica  		| Carolina      |
| Julia 		 | Caleb       |
| Rebecca		  | Chris        |
| Jordan  		| Bisola       |
| Bri 			| Maggie       |
| Emilie 	 | Noah        |
| Naiomi	 | Jake       |
| Mario		 | Omotola      |

## The Structure

The trial will take place over four classes. Please see the syllabus. 

| Day 1     | Opening statements |

| Day 2     | Prosecution's witnesses & cross-examination      |
| Day 3 		| Defense's witnesses  & cross-examination     |
| Day 4 		| Closing statements       |

## Roles 
You will need to identify people within each team to play the following roles: 

+ Two attorney for each team to deliver two opening statements. 
+ Three witnesses for each team. 
+ Three attorneys from each team to question the team's witnesses. 
+ Three attorneys to cross-examine the opposing team's witnesses. 
+ Two attorney from each team to deliver closing statements. 

While you should aim for a separate person to play each role, I am open to each team dividing the work up in alternative equitable ways. 

## The Charge - Corrupting the Youth of Athens

Socrates is charged with corrupting the youth of Athens. To successfully prosecute Socrates, the prosecution must prove three points: 

1. At least some of Socrates's students were corrupted, where this corruption means those students were individually harmed or their behavior ultimately harmed Athens. 
2. Being taught by Socrates was the proximate and direct cause of these students' corruption. 
3. Socrates was negligent in his teaching, i.e., any reasonable person could have foreseen that Socrates' students would have been corrupted, in someway or other, by his teaching. 


The defense must successfully argue against at least one of these elements. 


## Witnesses


| Prosecution    	 	| Defense |
| ----------- 			| ----------- |
| Alcibiades    		| Aristophanes      |
| 	Pending		    		 | 	Pending	     |
| 		Pending	   			  | 	Pending		     |

 - I am open to suggestions. But the other witnesses will likely include one of Socrates' students who apparently suffered individually, one great politician, and some successful student of Socrates. 

#### Some Research

The readings for this class provide rich information about many of the witnesses. But you should also find one good resources dedicated to each. 

+ ["Nemesis: Alcibiades and the Fall of Athens",](nemesis.pdf) by David Stuttard
+ [A short encyclopedia article on Alcibiades](https://www.worldhistory.org/Alcibiades/)
+ [The people of Plato,](people.pdf) Debra Nails
+ [Alcibiades](rhodes.pdf), Peter J. Rhodes 1985. 
+ 'The Clouds', by Aristophanes

## Assignments 
The grade will be divided across three types of assignments. I will formally detail these once we have allocated students to the various roles. 

1. Group research on the witnesses. This is the bulk of the work, and you should begin now. The assignment will consist in a research brief on all six witnesses. Each group must submit this brief. You should expect the brief to contain 2-3 pages of historical and philosophical *pertinent* research concerning each witness that will be used in the trial
2. Preparation for each individual role. This will vary by role, but expect about 2 pages per person. 
3. Performance of the role. 
4. 1-2 page individual reflection pieces on what you learned from the assignment
