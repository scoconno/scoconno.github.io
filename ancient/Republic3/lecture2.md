## Description of the Tyrant

S has distinguished between necessary and unnecessary desires and pleasures. 

Necessary desires:
: desires that cannot train ourselves to overcome. These are desires for objects that we need to survive, e.g., the desire for food. 

Unnecessary desires: 
: desires which we can train ourselves to overcome, e.g., desire for luxurious items and a decadent lifestyle. 

S begins his description of the tyrant by saying that some of the unnecessary desires are particular abhorrent. These are what he calls the lawless desires: 

+ They are the desires awakened in sleep when the rest of the soul-the rational, gentle, and ruling part-slumbers. During sleep, it is free from the control of shame and reason.
+ S lists 1) sexual desires for anyone and anything, e.g., family members, animals, etc. 2) Desires for violence, e.g., desires to commit murders. 3) Desires for all and every food. 4) Generally, and desire that we would normally be ashamed to admit having while awake. 
+ They are probably present in everyone, but they are held in check by the better desires in alliance with reason. In a few people, they have been eliminated entirely or only a few weak ones remain, while in others they are stronger and more numerous.

*How the tyrant comes to be*

+ Recall: the oligarch produces democratic children. T
+ The oligarchic parent is driven by thrift and greed. They value only desires that let them make money and hate those unnecessary desires that cause them to spend more than needed.
+ Child of the oligarch is rich, but hates their parents thriftiness. 
+ They associate people who desire the fine and uncessary things and are pulled between two types of desires, thrift and greed, and opulence. They indulge the latter more than their parents. 
+ But they do not become lawless since they don't completely abandon their parents' values. 
+ The child of the democrat does not have an oligarchic parent and the values of the democrat cannot put a check on their lawless desires. 
+ They develop an erotic love of the lawless desires. 
+ The tyrant arises when the lawless desires take hold 


> And when the other desires-filled with incense, myrrh, wreaths, wine, and the other pleasures found in their company-buzz around the drone, nurturing it and making it grow as large as possible, they plant the sting of longing in it. Then this leader of the soul adopts madness as its bodyguard and becomes frenzied. If it finds any beliefs or desires in the man that are thought to be good or that still have some shame, it destroys them and throws them out, until it's purged him of moderation and filled him with imported madness.

*How the tyrant lives*

+ Since erotic love rules, the tyrant directs all their energies to feasts, revelries, luxuries, sex, etc.
+ Unleashed, many desires demand satisfaction and the tyrant is singularly driven to acquire whatever is needed to satisfy them. 
+ They spend all their income, borrow wildly, sell all their goods. 
+ But desires need satisfaction, so when all this has gone, the tyrant will acquire whatever desire demands by any source. They takes and spends their parent's wealth without shame. They rob, bribe, loot temples, etc. They do this without shame. Beliefs and opinions about what is fine and noble have been replaced with variuos beliefs about what they deserve, and any other belief that lets these desires to be pursued without guilt and shame.
+ Tyrant associates with flatterers, makes merely instrumental friends, etc. They are driven to power to ensure that they have the means to satisfy their lawless desires without rebuke. 

> Now, however, under the tyranny of erotic love, he has permanently become while awake what he used to become occasionally while asleep, and he won't hold back from any terrible murder or from any kind of food or act. But, rather, erotic love lives like a tyrant within him, in complete anarchy and lawlessness as his sole ruler, and drives him, as if he were a city, to dare anything that will provide sustenance for itself and the unruly mob around it (some of whose members have come in from the outside as a result of his keeping bad company, while others have come from within, freed and let loose by his own bad habits). Isn't this the life that a tyrannical man leads?

His waking life is like the
nightmare we described earlier.

## Three Arguments that the Just person is the happiest


### First argument 576b-578b 

Just as a dictatorship is the least happy of cities, so the dictatorial person is the least happiest individual.

--city: best citizens are slaves and can least do what they want.

--person: best parts of the soul are enslaved and ruled by a small part which is the worst. 
 
 You're right. But what if some god were to lift one of these men, his fifty e
or more slaves, and his wife and children out of the city and deposit him with his slaves and other property in a deserted place, where no free person could come to his assistance? How frightened would he be that he himself and his wife and children would be killed by the slaves?

### Second argument 580c-583b

1. Each part of the soul has a distinct kind of pleasure, a kind of appetite and a kind of rule. 
2. Each part of the soul is motivated by its distinctive kind of desire.
	1. Reason desires knowledge and truth.
	2. Spirit desires honor, power, and fame.
	3. Appetite desires (i) food, drink, sex, rest, and (ii) wealth and money as a means to these. 
2. Different type of people are dominated by different parts.
	1. The philosopher has (i) fully experienced the pleasure of learning and understands the genuine value of wisdom, (ii) has fully experienced the pleasures of honor and rightly judges its limited value, (ii) has fully experienced the pleasures of wealth and rightly judges its very limited value. 
	2. The honor lover (i) does not really understand the value of learning wisdom and says it is valueless since it does not bring distinction, (ii) has experienced pleasure from honor, victory, strife, but mistakenly thinks honor is the highest value, (iii) thinks that pleasure of money is simply vulgar and grasps that wealth is of limited value.
	3. The wealth lover (i) lacks experience with value of learning or wisdom and says it is valueless since it does not bring wealth, (ii) lacks experience with value of honor or position and says it is valueless since it does not bring wealth, (iii) has experienced pleasure from wealth and gain, and mistakenly thinks wealth is highest value
4. Each type of person believes their life is most pleasant.
4. Only the philosopher, the one ruled by reason, has experience of all three types of pleasure. 
C1. Therefore, the philosopher is the most reliable judge of which life is most please.
C2. Therefore, the philosopher's life is the most pleasant. 


### Third argument 583b-585a

1. There are 3 sentient states: pleasure, pain, intermediate [neutrality?]
2.  Confusion can arise when people think that pleasure = absence of pain. Most bodily pleasures and anticipations of pleasure are of this kind. People are generally not aware of genuine pleasure. The greater pleasures come through the exercise of reason.
3. Just as hunger is an emptiness of the body, so ignorance is an emptiness of the soul. But the things that fill the latter are more real than the things that fill the former.
4. In proportion as sustenance and the thing sustained by it are more real, the resulting satisfaction is more real.
5. The body and the objects required to sustain are less real than the soul and the objects required to sustain it.
6. If the satisfaction is more real, then it produces more pleasure.
7. The just and philosophical life better satisfies the desires of the soul than does the unjust life.

5. So, the just and philosophical life is more pleasant than the unjust life.

### 588b-590c: The three part Creature:
A. Many-headed beast.
B. Lion
C. Man [sic: human-being]
--To praise injustice is to favor the enslavement of the man by the many headed beast. 
--To praise justice is to favor the man taming the beast, making the lion his ally, and caring for all in common.
590c-591a: Those with insufficient reason in their souls must be ruled by reason from without, thus producing a harmonious situation in which all citizens are ruled by the same thing.
591a-592b: The just individual is happiest and has the harmonious soul, whereas the unjust person is least happy even his/her injustices are not discovered.
