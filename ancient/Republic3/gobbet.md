These passages below are taken only from Book 8. You will need to read that book carefully (it takes me about 30 mins to read one book of the *Republic* properly.) You should also skim-read Book 9. For each passage, write a very short paragraph on *context*, *content*, and *assessment*.

*NB:* I picked passages that I'm confident you will either strongly agree with or disagree with. That's by design. Remember, your own evaluation of the claims happens in the assessment. In the context section, you set up the general topic of this Book and say how this passage relates to that topic. In the content section, you leave aside your personal views and try to charitably explain what Socrates is saying and why he is saying it. You can cut loose in the assessment section.



**Passage 1**

Summing up all of these things together, then, do you notice how sensitive they make the citizens' souls, so that if anyone tries to impose the least degree of slavery [i.e., control], they [the citizens] get irritated and cannot bear it. In the end, as I am sure you are aware, they take no notice of the the laws, written or unwritten, in order to avoid having any master at all [i.e., in order to avoid being controlled by anyone or anything] (563d). 

**Passage 2**

And it is clear that when a tyrant arises, the position of popular leader is the sole root from which he springs (565d).
