## Physics ##

The Stoics think that the universe consists of two principles. 

God:
: Immanent in the whole of nature and directs its development down to the smallest detail. It is the active principle. It is associated with reason or intelligent designing fire which structures matter in accordance with its plan. Everything happens according to God's providential plan. 

Matter:
: Utterly unqualified and inert. It is what is acted upon. God, the active principle, acts upon this matter to build everything that exists. Note that God does not craft the world from outside. Activity in the universe is the activity of God.

The Stoics believe in eternal recurrence. They think that everything is enacted over and over. Fire leads to various elements, which lead to the world, which leads back to fire. 


## Soul ##

The Stoics conceive of the soul as wholly rational. 

+ A desire/impulse for X is identical to a belief that X is good for you, i.e., it promotes your well-being. A fear of X is identical to a belief that X is harmful to you.
+ Beliefs arise in the following way: An external object impresses itself upon the soul, which generates an “impression” or “presentation” that something is the case. The soul either assents (i.e. accepts the content of the impression) and a belief is formed, or withholds (i.e. does not accept) and a belief is not formed
+ So, you have an impression that X is good and you assent to that impression. Only then do you have a desire, action. 
+ Thus, our desires are under our control (since our assent is under our control). Compare this to someone who says we first desire X, then decide whether X is good or bad. The Stoics think that all desires includes a decision that x is good. 

## Ethics

The Stoics agree that the goal of life is happiness or flourishing. But they disagree with their predecessors about the nature of happiness. They characterized happiness in several ways, as "a good flow of life”, "living in agreement", “living in agreement with nature”, “living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature”, and, finally, "the rational selection of the primary things according to nature." 

There are two notions of 'nature': 

1. Living in accordance with nature as a whole, i.e. the entire cosmos. Since the universe is a rationally organized and well-ordered system, all events fit within a coherent, well-structured scheme that is providential. There is no room for chance within this rationally ordered system. The Stoics think we must conform our will with the sequence of events that are fated to occur in the rationally constituted universe.
2. Living in accordance with our own specific constitution and character. This notion of ‘nature' is used when we say it is the nature of fire to move upward.  To "live in agreement with nature" in this second sense include things like taking in nutrition, growth, reproduction, sense-perception, locomotion, impulse to care for offspring i.e., doing all the things that are in our nature. The Stoics believed that compared to other animals, human beings are neither the strongest, nor the fastest, nor the best swimmers, nor able to fly. Instead, the distinct and uniquely human capacity is reason. Thus for human beings, "living in agreement with nature" means living in agreement with our special, innate endowment—the ability to reason.


So whole universe is God. each part is naturally constituted so that it seeks what is apporpriate or suitable to it, just as our own body parts are so constituted as to preserve both themselves and the whole of which they are parts.
- only goods are the characteristic excellences of human minds--prudeence, widsom, justice, courage and so on.
- Exercise of virtues is necessary and sufficient for happiness.
- They say that some things which value but which are not good. Health and wealth are to be preferred because they are typically appropriate--fitting for us.

- We have natural impulse for preservations---so aim for preservation. food and warmth. Since we are rational, people are appropriate to us. Perfection of our rational natures. 
- It's about the rational choice of indifferents. You are happy if you are selecting rationally---you don't need to obtain them. 
- emotions are excesses that prevent us rationally selecting what we should. But we can have impulses.

## Appropriation
The Stoics think that the happy life consists in a kind of awareness of what is appropriate to us. The organism is aware of its own constitution. This awareness involves the immediate recognition of its own body as “belonging to” itself. The creature is thus directed toward maintaining its constitution in its proper, i.e. its natural, condition. As a consequence, the organism is impelled to preserve itself by pursuing things that promote its own well-being and by avoiding things harmful to it. Pleasure is only a by-product of success in this activity. In the case of a human infant, for example, appropriation explains why the baby seeks his mother’s milk. But as the child matures, his constitution evolves. The child continues to love himself, but as he matures into adolescence his capacity for reason emerges and what he recognizes as his constitution, or self, is crucially transformed. Where he previously identified his constitution as his body, he begins to identify his constitution instead with his mental faculty (reason) in a certain relation to his body. In short, the self that he now loves is his rationality. Our human reason gives us an affinity with the cosmic reason, Nature, that guides the universe. The fully matured adult thus comes to identify his real self, his true good, with his completely developed, perfected rational soul. This best possible state of the rational soul is exactly what virtue is.

Whereas the first stage of the theory of appropriation gives an account of our relationship toward ourselves, the second stage explains our social relationship toward others. The Stoics observed that a parent is naturally impelled to love her own children and have concern for their welfare. Parental love is motivated by the child's intimate affinity and likeness to her. But since we possess reason in common with all (or nearly all) human beings, we identify ourselves not only with our own immediate family, but with all members of the human race—they are all fellow members of our broader rational community. In this way the Stoics meant social appropriation to constitute an explanation of the natural genesis of altruism.
