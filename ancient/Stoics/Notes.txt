Virtues 

- Recap: Aristotle searches for the ultimate good for human beings. This would tell us why we should live; what we should do with our lives. We have agreed that this good is called happiness (eudaimonia), but have noticed that there is disagreement about the nature of happiness; while everyone agrees that 'to be happy' is the ultimate reason why humans do anything, they disagree what it takes to be happy. 
- Aristotle has observed that whatevver happiness is, it must be a good that is self-sufficient and complete. 
- After identifying these two features of happiness, he proposes to search for happiness by reflecting on the nature of human beings; presumably whatever it is for a human to be happy has something to do with what it is to be human. It would be surprising if happiness was beyond the reach of human capacities. It wouldn't be that surprising if hapiness related somehow to our capacities. 
- Aristotle surprised us however by turning to discuss the related notion of function and virtue; he claimed that the good of everything with a function was to perform that function well. The virtue of anything with a function is whatever allows that entity perform the function well. This leads Aristotle to conclude that to be a good human is to perform the characteristic activity of a human in accordance with virtue---i.e., to perform it in the way you would if you have virtues---, i.e., to preform it well. 
- What is that function? We saw that it was reason, but that more will need to be said. There are two ways that we are rational. We both issues rational commands and obey rational commands. 
- There must, then, be virtues that allow humans to listen to rational commands well. There are others that let us issue commands. The former are called virtues of character. The latter are called virtues of thought. 
- One way to think of this is to consider a person who refuses to listen to reason. Their parents and teachers give rational, decent orders, but they refuse. The even order themselves about, but refuse to obey. Some listen to reason. Others do not. Aristotle say that the first act in accordance with virtue. The second does not act in accordance with virtue. 
- Book II investigates virtue. We were expecting Aristotle to look at the virtues that allow us listen to reason. Very quickly we will find that the virtues concern ordinary moral virtues, i.e., temperance, prudence, etc. What's going on? 
- Ch.1-4 investigate the relationship between virtues and actions as well as investigates how virtue is acquired. Our main emphasis is that Aristotle thinks that actions are caused by states. We all engage in regular patterns of behavior given varying environmental conditions. Aristotle assumes that the regular pattern of behavior is caused by something in us. He gives a variety of options. 
- Ok, so the way to explain this is to begin by asking students to compare people who have regular patterns of behavior. Can you think of a person who always obeys authority figures? Can you think of a person who always rejects them? And what about people who always obey themselves? What about people who can never obey themselves?
