### The Structure

| ----------- 			| ----------- |

### The Roles 
You will need to identify people within each team to play the following roles: 

+ Two attorneys for each team to deliver two opening statements. 
+ Two witnesses for each team. 
+ Three attorneys from each team to question their own team's witnesses. 
+ Three attorneys to cross-examine the opposing team's witnesses. 
+ Two attorneys from each team to deliver closing statements. 

While you should aim for a separate person to play each role, I am open to each team dividing the work up in alternative equitable ways. 

### The Charge - Corrupting the Youth of Athens

Socrates is charged with corrupting the youth of Athens. To successfully prosecute Socrates, the prosecution must prove three points: 

1. At least some of Socrates's students were corrupted, where this corruption means those students were individually harmed or their behavior ultimately harmed Athens. 
2. Being taught by Socrates was the proximate and direct cause of these students' corruption. 
3. Socrates was negligent in his teaching, i.e., any reasonable person could have foreseen that Socrates' students would have been corrupted, in someway or other, by his teaching. 


The defense must successfully argue against at least one of these points. 


### Witnesses


| Prosecution    	 	| Defense |
| ----------- 			| ----------- |
| Alcibiades    		| Aristophanes      |
| 	Euthyphro		    		 | 	Crito	     |


#### Some Research

The readings for this class provide rich information about many of the witnesses. But you should also find one good resources dedicated to each. 

+ ["Nemesis: Alcibiades and the Fall of Athens",](nemesis.pdf) by David Stuttard
+ [A short encyclopedia article on Alcibiades](https://www.worldhistory.org/Alcibiades/)
+ [The people of Plato,](people.pdf) Debra Nails
+ [Alcibiades](rhodes.pdf), Peter J. Rhodes 1985. 
+ 'The Clouds', by Aristophanes

### Assignments 
The grade will be assigned to each group holistically. There are three elements:  

1. Research brief: The brief should contain 2-3 pages of historical and philosophical *pertinent* research concerning each witness that will be used in the trial. This must be one unified brief. Make sure to edit to ensure there is one *voice*.
2. Preparation for the witnesses and attorneys. For the attorneys, this should include a list of questions and anticipated questions based on possible responses. For the witnesses, this should include anticipated questions and planned answers. Expect about 1-2 pages per witness per role.
3. Performance of the role.
