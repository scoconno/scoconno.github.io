title: Assignment 1
---

Humanity has struggled through many pandemics, and many of the difficulties we have faced are similar to those our predecessors have grappled with. The goal of this assignment is to teach you just how often humanity has struggled through a pandemic, and also to teach you how, despite being separated by time and place, our struggles are not so different from those of our predecessors. 

In ch.1 and 2 of the textbook, the author, Pence, offers a brief history of different pandemics. Pick *one* virus. After providing a brief history of that virus--where it appeared, its effects, how many it killed, etc.,-- compare and contrast that virus with what you currently know about Covid-19, and describe one ethical dilemma/question that our predecessors' grappled with that is similar to an ethical dilemma/issue that we grapple with as we confront Covid-19. 

Further instructions: 

+ Write 250-500 words. This word count does not include any footnote, headers, bibliography, etc. 
+ Submit your response to Blackboard as a MSWord file; each NJCU student has free access to 365 Online. 
+ Since this is a short assignment, I encourage you to only use the textbook. 
+ Include a bibliography even if you have only used your textbook; it's good practice.  
+ This is a short assignment. Do not quote extensively. Generally, you must always explain in your own words anything that you have quotes; you can't use quotes to do the work for you. 
+ I use plagiarism detection software. Failure to cite material that you use in part or full, in paraphrase or direct quotation, violates NJCU's academic integrity policy. See the syllabus for more information.
