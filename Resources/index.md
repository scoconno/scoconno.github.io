### Critical Thinking Resources

+ Wi-Phi has a series of [short videos on critical thinking](http://www.wi-phi.com/videos/Critical-Thinking)
+ Critical thinking glossaries [here](http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/ct/glos.html) and [here.](http://mcckc.edu/services/criticalthinking/criticalthinkingproject/glossary.asp)
+ I use ['The Power of Critical Thinking', by Lewis Vaughn](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-power-of-critical-thinking-9780199856671?cc=us&lang=en&) in my critical thinking classes. The textbook's [companion website](http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199856671/student/) has self assessment quizzes and other useful tools. 

### Study Resources

Productive study requires focus. That's not easy. If you are like me, you get distracted by email, notifications, news stories, etc. I have had success using an app called 'Freedom'. I use it to block my access to specific sites and apps, or, at times, the entire internet.  

+ Try freedom [here](https://freedom.refersion.com/c/8f6a6)

I also have success using the pomodoro technique. A 'pom' is 25 minutes of dedicated work. Anyone can avoid distraction for 25 minutes. If the phone rings, I ignore it. If I get thirsty, I wait until the pom finishes. A pom is followed by  a five minute break. Four poms are followed by a one hour break.  Instead of trying to complete a specific number of tasks a day, I attempt to complete a specific number of poms a day. There are plenty of free pomodoro apps that make it easy to time your work.
