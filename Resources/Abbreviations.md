## Grading Abbreviations

Below is a list of abbreviations that I use when grading papers and exams. I won't correct every instance of an error, or indeed every error. For instance, if I point to a word that you need to define, I may not point to every other word that needs to be defined. You should read through your paper and see whether there are further instances of the error.



+ ?
: I can’t understand the meaning of the sentence or phrase.

+ Awk.
: Awkward: The sentence or phrase indicated is poorly put and difficult to understand.

+ Con
: Consistency difficulty: You are being inconsistent here.

+ DEF
: Define what the indicated phrase or word means. 

+ ElAB
: Elaborate: This needs support. Why have you said this? Why or how is what you have written of use in your argument?

+ FI
: Follow instructions: You have not followed the instructions given in the prompt.

+ IAB
: intellectual autobiography (e.g. “The first time I heard this argument, it seemed really powerful….”); don’t give one.

+ IRR
: Irrelevant to the point of the paragraph or the essay.

+ LOG
: Logic: Logic is unclear or impossible.

+ MQ
: Mis-quotation: The quotation is inaccurate.

+ MW
: Missing word.

+ NG
: Not grammatical: consult a grammar guide. 

+ NP
: New paragraph: Break this into a new paragraph. Make each paragraph contain one point. 

+ NNP
: No new paragraph: You've started a new paragraph where you shouldn't.

+ NSE
: Non-Standard English.

+ PR
: Proof read! By this point in your essay there have simply been too many mechanical errors to justify your receiving as high a grade as you could. I will not correct further mistakes.

+ QUOT
: Quote: Is this a quotation? Where are the quotation marks? 

+ RED
: Redundant: The paragraph, sentence, phrase or word indicated is unnecessary. Cut it.

+ REL
: Relevance: How do you get from the idea in the former sentence (or phrase) to that of the latter? What is their relationship? The transition is unclear.

+ REP
: Repetition: you have already said this; move on

+ SL
: Slang: Avoid it.

+ SP
: Spelling: Correct the spelling/punctuation of this word.

+ TB
: Too brief: You are on track but you have left out steps or important details.

+ TG
: Too General: What you’ve said makes sense, but you need to explain more–facts need to be more specific, or supporting reasons need to be given.

+ WW
: Wrong word: this is the wrong word for the context; get a dictionary and look up the word you have used to find out why it is the wrong choice

+ WU
: Warm Up: What has been said doesn’t advance your answer. (Example: "Brock is a philosopher who writes about euthanasia.")

+ X
: Incorrect. Either facts or argument are in error. 

+ WC
: Word Choice: tou've used a word in an incorrect or awkward way. Consult a dictionary.
