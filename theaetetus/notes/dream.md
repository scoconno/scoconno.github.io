**The Metaphysics of the Dream Argument (201c7*ff*)**

*ยง1. Introduction.*

Theaetetus recalls hearing a man claim that knowledge is true judgement
with an account (*logos*) (201c7-202d1). Call this KTA.[^1] Theaetetus also recalls that the man claimed that there is an asymmetry between
things that have accounts and things that do not have accounts:

> A1: There is an x such that x has not account and is hence unknowable
> and there is y such that y has an account and is hence knowable.[^2]

Socrates first develops the metaphysical underpinnings of KTA before
arguing that it is a wind-egg. The development come in the form of a
dream, which has two parts:

> M: Humans and everything else, i.e. complexes (*sullabai*) are
> composed[^3] of primary elements (*stoicheia*) (201e1-3)

Secondly, an asymmetry claim:

> A2: (i) The primary elements have no account. (ii) The complexes that
> are composed of primary elements do have an account.

From KTA and A2, Socrates eventually draws the following inference:

> A3: The elements are unknowable and the complexes knowable.
> (202d8-202e1).

A2 and A3 jointly entail the following:

> A4: (i) The primary elements have no account *iff* the primary
> elements are unknowable and (ii) the complexes have an account *iff*
> they are knowable. [^4]

While there has been much discussion on A2, for my purposes, I can
stipulate that 'complex' and 'element' are perfectly general terms
applying to both semantic, physical, abstract, particular and universal
entities, i.e. it applies to anything that can properly be called a
complex and anything that can be properly called an element. Further,
while I do not here discuss what sort of account complexes have and
elements fail to have, I make the following observations. Firstly,
Socrates claims that the elements only have names, and the account of a
complex is woven together from the names of its elements. I stipulate
that the reason that elements only have names is that the 'other
things', other features/properties/parts, are applied to all things
alike (202a5-6). His point, I take it, is that while elements can be
referred to by proper names, they cannot be uniquely described as they
have no peculiar intrinsic features, i.e. a feature or property or part
that a single element possesses alone (itself by itself). Since accounts
must contain or refer to peculiar intrinsic features/properties/parts,
elements do not have accounts. What is important to what follows is to
recognize how 'naked' the elements are.

*ยง2 The Dilemma*

Socrates presents a dilemma against A4 that turns on the relationship
between a complex and its elements. He argues that either both complexes
and their elements are equally knowable or complexes and their elements
are equally unknowable.[^5]

Socrates' strategy is to take paradigms or 'models' of elements and
complexes, letters and syllables. The account of the syllable 'SO' is
'S' and 'O'. Hence, 'SO' is knowable. There is no account of S and there
is no account of O. Hence, the individual letters are unknowable. What
justifies using letters and syllables as models? The Greek for
elements/letters and complexes/syllables is the same. It is only context
that allows us determine whether Socrates is referring to the linguistic
items or something more general. Hence, inferring how complexes and
elements are related as such from how letters and syllables are related
is reasonable to a Greek ear.[^6] The two horns of the dilemma are
stated as follows:

> What do we mean by 'the syllable'? The two letters (or if there are
> more, all the letters)? Or do we mean some single form produced by
> their combination. (203c3-6)

This quote describes two possible relationships between a syllabus and
its constituent letters. Either a syllable is numerically identical to
all its letters, or a syllabus is produced by, and so numerically
distinct from, its constituent letters. Since I take the discussion to
be perfectly general, we have here an instance of the standard
mereologists concern over the relationship between parts and wholes. Are
wholes identical to their parts?

Socrates does not, however, defend any answer to this question. Instead,
he argues that, however we answer this question, A4 is false. In
particular, he intends to show that there can be asymmetry between the
knowability of the complexes and elements; either they are both knowable
or both unknowable.

*ยง3. Horn 1*

His strategy here is to show that if a syllable is numerically identical
to all its letters then necessarily if a syllable is knowable then so
are its letters.

P1: SO = 'S and O'

P2: B knows SO

P3: From P1 and P2, B knows 'S and O'

P4: B knows 'S and O' *iff* B knows S and B knows O.

C1: From P3 and P4, B knows S and B knows O.

C2: Hence, if SO is knowable then S is knowable and B is knowable.[^7]

The argument is quick and commits two 'apparent' fallacies.[^8] The
first relates to the substitutivity of co-extensional terms into opaque
contexts. This is a fallacy:

A)  Superman = Clark Kent

B)  Louis knows Superman

C)  Therefore, Louis knows Clark Kent.

C is an invalid inference from A and B. Likewise, one might charge
Socrates with an invalid inference from P1 and P2 to P3. If B knows SO
it should not immediately follow that B knows 'S and O'.

I have one solution. The argument is concerned with whether certain
entities have accounts and are knowable. There is an important subtlety
with the concept of being 'knowable'. On the one hand, to claim that 'x
is knowable' might be a purely epistemological claim. In general, when
we claim that 'x is knowable' we often are just making a claim about
some possible knower, some possible knower could know x. However, there
is a distinct more robustly metaphysical notion of 'knowability'. For
instance, to claim that God is unknowable or Godel sentences are
unknowable (or unprovable in the case of Godel) is to ascribe some
feature not just to a possible knower but to the object in question,
i.e. there is something in the nature of God that makes her unknowable.
If Socrates' intends the metaphysical claim then the argument does not
obviously fail to notice opacity, i.e.

D)  S = S and O

E)  S is knowable

F)  It follows from D and E that 'S and O' is knowable.

For the inference to be valid only requires 1) that knowable be a real
property and 2) the indiscernibility of identicals. To put it another
way, if SO has some property P precisely in virtue of which it is
knowable, then since SO is identical to 'S and O', 'S and O' must have
P, and hence be knowable.[^9]

The second fallacy is committed in P4 is called the fallacy of division.
This is a fallacy:

A)  7 = 3 and 4

B)  7 is odd

C)  From A and B it follows that 3 is odd and 4 is odd.

Likewise, one might worry that Socrates argues invalidly from the claim
that 'S and O' is knowable 'together' to the claim that S individually
is knowable and O is individually knowable.

The charge is misplaced. According to H1: SO = S 'and' O. What sort of
claim is this? Firstly, I have presented the claim using 'and'. However,
Socrates contrasts H2 with H1 by claiming that in H2 the elements are
combined. In H1 the elements are not combined. We have no reason to
think that the 'and' expresses any significant relationship that S and O
stand in at all.[^10] This one thing SO is meant to be numerically
identical to these two things S, O.[^11] Take the following argument:

1)  SO = the set {S, O}

2)  SO has a property P.

3)  From 2, the set {S, O} has P.

We can ask what subject has P? Do S and O individually have P? Assume
that it is not the case that S has P and O has P but the set of them
does. It would follow that the set {S, O} is some distinct entity above
and beyond its member. That is, if you count up the number of subjects
you would count three, S, O and the set of both. However, on h1 there
just is no single subject above and beyond S and O. On H1, f you count
up the syllable SO and you count the letters S and O separately, you
should only count two things, S, O.

One might still claim that there is no third subject that is P but
resist accepting that P is predicated individually of S and of O.
Perhaps one might claim that P is somehow a relation that S and O stand
in but is not predicated of each, e.g. two straight lines are parallel
but neither line 'itself by itself' is parallel. However, recall two
things here. One, on H1 there is no mode of combination for the elements
allowed, i.e. it is unclear whether elements can stand in relations.
Secondly, and more importantly, recall how 'naked' the elements are.
There are no intrinsic properties that the relations can supervene on.
That is, two lines are parallel because they have the same length but
elements however have nothing like length in virtue of which they could
stand in a relation one to another.[^12]

Conclusions: On the assumption that a syllable is identical to allits
letters and given how 'naked' the elements are, it is reasonable for
Socrates to conclude that any property had of a syllable should be had
by each of its letters. Since he takes knowability to be such a
property, it is reasonable to conclude that if the syllables/complexes
are knowable then so too are the letters/elements. Hence, on H1, A4 is
false.

*ยง4. Horn 2*[^13]

Recall that on H2 a syllable is some single form produced by the
combination of all its letters, i.e. a syllable/complex is numerically
identical to a single from (*eidos*) and is not numerically identical to
all its letters/elements. Its letters combine to produce the syllable.
Socrates does not tell us what he means by 'form', 'combine' and
'produce'. In fact, he speaks merely of the syllable coming to be from
the letters. Socrates probably intends the argument to be sufficiently
general so that it applies to different types of production and
combination, e.g. the way letters combine vs. the way parts of the body
combine. His strategy is to show that if the syllable is not identical
to all its elements then both the syllable and its letters are
unknowable (contra A4). The argument is hard! Here is the general
structure (203e1-205d3):

P1: A syllable is a single form.

> P2: If a syllable is a single form, then a syllable does not have
> parts.

P3: If a syllable does not have parts, then a syllable does not have
elements (205b)

> P4: If a syllable does not have elements, then a syllable does not
> have an account and is hence unknowable.
>
> C1: It follows from P1-P4 that a syllable does not have an account and
> is hence unknowable.
>
> C2: A complex does not have an account and is hence unknowable.
>
> C3: If an element has no account and is unknowable then from C2 a
> complex does not have an account and is hence unknowable.

P1 is assumed on H1. Most of the discussion turns on arguing for P2. P3
is taken as obvious. If a syllable did not have letters as parts, then
what else could its parts be? P4 follows from KTA and the claim that the
account of a syllable/complex must be given in terms of
letters/elements. C2 is a generalization of C1. C3 shows that it follows
from C2 that A4 is false.

The argument for P2 requires us to distinguish between complexes and
elements on the one hand, and parts and wholes on the other hand.
Socrates strategy is to show first that wholes are numerically identical
to their parts. Secondly, he intends to show that if a syllable is a
single form and not numerically to its elements, it follows that a
syllable is not a whole with parts. The argument that a whole must be
identical to its parts takes the form of a familiar dilemma:

> a\) Either a whole is identical to all its parts or b) a whole is
> identical to some single form that has come into being from its parts
> and is distinct from all its parts. (204a6-9)

Socrates argues against b and hence for a. The heart of the argument
rests on the distinction between 'all of it' and 'all of them', e.g. all
of Socrates and all of Socrates' parts.[^14] There are two significant
steps:

S1: All of Socrates are identical to all of Socrates' parts.

> S2: Either (i) if all of Socrates is identical to the whole of
> Socrates, then the whole of Socrates is identical to all of Socrates'
> parts, i.e.:

all the parts of Socrates = all of Socrates = the whole of Socrates

> Or (ii) if all of Socrates is not identical to the whole of Socrates
> then Socrates does not have parts.

The argument for S1 is by example:

> 'one, two, three, four, five, six' (i) = six
>
> 'twice three' (ii) = six
>
> 'three times two (iii) = six
>
> 'four plus two' (iv) = six
>
> 'three plus two plus one' (v) = six.

Each of (i) -- (v) is identical to six. The argument is under-described.
However, the point is that the parts of six are identical to all of
six.[^15] It is important to realize here that Plato is employing a very
specific concept of number (*arithmos*).[^16] That is, he is here
thinking of numbers as enumerable collections or units. So '5' is five
units or a quintet. '6' is six units or a sextet. The parts, then, of
six are the six units that make it, a sextet, up. Further, a quintet is
part of a sextet just in virtue of the fact that the five units that are
the quintet are parts of the six units that are the sextet. So, on this
view five really is part of six. Now Socrates is here arguing that no
matter how you count the six units, all six units together are identical
to six, i.e. no matter how you describe the parts of six, all the parts
of six are identical to all of six. This we should note is obvious given
that the definition of what it is for something to be six (i.e. a
sextet) is to be six units. As an example:

Here, there is a sextet of lollipop men. There is also a dublet, a
triplet, etc. The quintet is part of the sextet just in virtue of the
fact that each unit that is part of the quintet is also part of the
sextet. It should be clear that the doublet plus the quartet of lollipop
men is identical to the sextet of lollipop men, i.e. there is a one-one
equivalence relation between the members of the set of lollipop men
formed by the addition of the dublet and quartet and the set that makes
up the members of the sextet. Hence, all of these units/lollipop men
together are identical to the sextet of lollipop men, e.g. to six
lollipop men.

So Socrates takes himself to have shown that in the case of six, all of
six is identical to all the parts of six together. He then generalizes
from this conclusion to the claim that for all x, if x is made up of
number then all of x is identical to all the parts of x.

What does Socrates mean by 'being made up of number'? Socrates discusses
three cases, an acre, a mile and an army. Now he certainly does not mean
that the number 5 is part of an acre. Recall, he is thinking of numbers
as enumerable collections of units. So to claim that x is made up of
number is just to say that x is made up of a number of units. To go
further here requires us to supply a claim not explicitly contained in
the text. That is, what is a unit? I do not deny that Plato can allow
himself a formal or abstract notion of unit. However, in this argument
it is best to assume that a unit is always a unit relative to some
measure or other. There are then in fact many different units depending
on what we want to measure. For instance, to measure whether something
is one foot long we need to ascertain whether it is, say, twelve inches.
So, inch is here the appropriate unit. To ascertain whether a field is
an acre we need to see whether it is 4,840 square yards. Square yards
are here the units that we measure. Likewise, to ascertain whether
something is an army we need to ascertain whether it has 4 corps.[^17]
Corps is here the unit by which we measure. So, Socrates' strategy here
is to claim that there are certain things that are essentially *n*F
(where F is some unit or other and *n* is the number of F that the thing
must have). In these cases, he can infer that all of x is identical to
all the parts of x. For example, an army is 4 corps. All of an army is
identical to all the parts of army, i.e. all of an army is identical to
its 4 corps.

Does this argument generalize? Socrates needs to show that all things
are like armies and acres. That is, for any x that has parts, Socrates
has to claim that x is made up of a number of parts, i.e. is *n*F. If
Kate Moss, for instance, has parts but is not *n*F then Socrates is not
entitled to infer that all of Kate Moss is identical to all the parts of
Kate Moss. The argument is perspicuous in its omission. We might help
Socrates by distinguishing between a specific number of parts and some
number or other. The argument will go through on even this weaker
reading. So while we might question whether everything has some specific
number of parts, it seems reasonable to assume that everything that has
parts has some number or other, i.e. Kate Moss has some number or other
of parts. All that this requires is that for any entity that has parts,
it must have more than one part.[^18] Besides, normally we express the
relationship between a whole and parts as a one many relationship, i.e.
Kate Moss has many parts. So, if Socrates assumes that anything that has
parts has many parts, and since 'many' is concept of quantity, I take it
that he is on safe grounds to say that things that have parts, have a
number of them.

Socrates can then conclude that all of x = all the parts of x. The
argument at this point seems to be as follows (I use 'Socrates' as my
variable):

> G1: Either the whole of Socrates = all of Socrates or \~the whole of
> Socrates = all of Socrates.

G2: All of Socrates = all the parts of Socrates.

> G3: From G1 and G2 it follows that if the whole of Socrates = all of
> Socrates, then the whole of Socrates = all the parts of Socrates.
>
> G4: From G1 and G2 it follows that if \~the whole of Socrates = all of
> Socrates, then \~the whole of Socrates = all the parts of Socrates.
>
> G5: If \~the whole of Socrates = all the parts of Socrates, then
> Socrates does not consist of parts.
>
> G6: The whole of Socrates must consist of parts.
>
> G7: It follows from G6&G7, that the whole of Socrates = all the parts
> of Socrates.

The argument is valid but not obviously sound. The argument turns on the
fact that Socrates is only allowing one possible relation between the
whole of x and all the parts of x, i.e. identity. However, it is
important to stress that the failure is not immediately to notice that
there could be some other relation that a whole stands in to all its
parts. Rather, it immediately turns on not allowing any other relation
between the whole of x and all of x. That is, between a whole and a mere
aggregate or sum. It is in this context that certain theories of forms
or structures are articulated, i.e. to distinguish aggregates from
wholes. That is, one would not introduce structure to distinguish say
Socrates from all his parts. Rather, structure would be introduced to
distinguish Socrates from the mere aggregate or sum of all his parts,
i.e. he is not a mere aggregate of parts.

Irrespective of whether Plato would full heartedly sign up to G1-G7, we
can wrap up the argument. We recall that on H2, a syllable is taken as
numerically distinct from its letters. It is composed of them. Now if a
complex has parts, then elements are its parts. However, if it has
parts, then it is a whole. But if it is a whole with parts then it must
be identical to those parts. Hence, we get impaled on H1. However, if a
syllable is not identical to its parts, then it is not a whole. Hence, a
syllable does not have parts. Hence, it does not have elements. Hence,
it does not have an account. Hence, it is unknowable. Hence, A4 is
false.

Conclusion: either a complex is identical to its elements or it is a
single form that is distinct from its elements. On either horn, A4 is
false.

[^1]: I am not here going to discuss a) what sense of *logos* is being
    employed b) the relationship that a true judgment and a *logos* are
    meant to stand in. For epistemology of the argument see Gail Fine

[^2]: Distinguish A1 from A1\`: for all x, if x does not have an account
    then x is not knowable & if x does have an account then x is
    knowable. KTA clearly implies the conditional claim A1\`. However,
    KTA does not imply the existential claim A1 that there *are* both
    things without accounts and things with accounts. Hence, if you
    reject A1 you do not thereby reject KTA. For instance, it is
    possible that everything has accounts and is knowable.

[^3]: The Greek is *sugkeimai*. This can be translated 'lie together' or
    'compound' 'compose' etc. The discussion that follows will be
    centered on the nature of this relation. It is hence best to suspend
    too specific a translation here.

[^4]: Note: A4 is an instance of A1. A1 only implies A4 on the
    assumption of M, i.e. that everything is either a complex or an
    element.

[^5]: The falsity of A4 does not entail the falsity of KTA. Socrates
    does not explicitly state that KTA *entails* A4, and he is right to
    do so. I take Socrates to be donning his mid-wife hat in providing
    one promising way of developing KTA, Theaetetus's suggestion. In a
    similar way, I agree with those who deny that Protagoras's *measure
    doctrine* is entailed by the claim that knowledge is perception; it
    is rather one very promising way of developing and defending that
    suggesting.

[^6]: It might also be reasonable to an English speakers' ear. The point
    is that if a skeptic questioned what licensed the move from
    syllables/letters to say humans/elements, Socrates would likely
    reply that the complex/element relationship is a general one that
    applies equally to all things that can properly called complexes and
    elements.

[^7]: This is a presentation of the argument found in 203c-d.

[^8]: cf. Verity Harte

[^9]: For this non agent centered notion of 'knowability' or 'being
    known' see for instance David Armstrong's Eleatic Principle in
    *Truth and Truthmakers* (2004), Sydney Shoemakers 'Causality and
    Properties' 1980, Plato's *Sophist* (reference to argument that
    forms are changeable in respect of being known when known)

[^10]: cf. Harte. She claims on this horn of the dilemma composition is
    innocent.

[^11]: If you are having difficulty with H1 then you are not alone. In
    modern discussions, the thesis that we find under H1 usually comes
    under the title 'composition is identity', i.e. a whole is identical
    to its parts. There are some who argue explicitly against this
    thesis but there are others, famously Peter Van Inwagen, who
    complain further that they just cannot understand the claim
    (\*\*\*\*). His worry is that we are being asked to accept that one
    thing is numerically identical to many things, something beyond the
    realm of conceivability. Irrespective of whether Plato likewise
    accepts that the thesis is incomprehensible, it is important to see
    that the thesis that composition is identity is assumed in H1.

[^12]: Verity Harte is very keen to see Plato as arguing against
    defenders of the composition is identity thesis, most importantly
    David Lewis. But we should be very careful to note that David Lewis'
    'primary elements' are not naked. Lewis' primary elements have
    intrinsic properties and relations supervene upon these intrinsic
    properties. He further uses technical machinery and global
    supervenience to provide a subject for predicates that seem to apply
    to a whole but not its parts. So it is not at all clear that we can
    take Plato in dialogue with David Lewis in the way Harte would have
    us imagine.

[^13]: I find myself being impaled just re-constructing this horn. My
    re-construction of the argument does not map linearly on to the
    discussion. However, it is the best I can do in identifying the line
    of reasoning.

[^14]: I follow Harte here in translating '*to pan*' as 'all of it'
    rather than 'sum' and '*ta panta*' as 'all of them', i.e. all the
    parts. The argument at this point is to establish that '*to pan*'
    and '*ta panta*' are the same '*tauton*'. I am here assuming that
    'all of them' means the same as 'all the parts'.

[^15]: I am hedging. I do not fully understand why Socrates enumerates
    the different ways of 'getting' six. He is perhaps arguing from
    cases. That is, there are five possible ways of describing the parts
    of six and under each possible description all the parts of six are
    identical to all of six.

[^16]: We would define six as the integer that comes after five in the
    series of natural number. We would be unlikely to take five as part
    of six. The view of number being employed by Socrates comes under
    sustained attack by Frege (Foundations of Arithmetic \*\*\* )

[^17]: An army is 2-4 corps depending on era and region of the world.
    Since, by definition, an army must have one and no more than one
    general, 'general' might be more appropriate to define a unit of
    measurement, i.e. 'lead by one general'.

[^18]: The discussion assumes that objects do not have themselves as
    parts, i.e. we are here speaking of proper parts.
