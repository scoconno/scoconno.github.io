## Wax Tablet Model (taken from Joshua Cline)

> I am going to maintain that we were wrong to agree that it is impossible for a man to be in error through judging that things he knows are things he doesn’t know. In a way, it is possible (191a11-b2).

**Basic Assumptions**

+ Thought is repesentational and perception is not, e.g., I think of X as X, but I do not perceive X as X
+ Knowledge is recalling (thinking of) a memory.
+ For all x, x can be an object of S’s judgment only if S is thinking of x (from memory) or is perceiving x.
+ False judgment occurs whenever S mistakes a present perception with a present memory.


### 17 options!!!!

SB = S believes that, say, x is y. 
M = remembers
K = knows
P = perceives
~ = not

**Impossible Misidentifications**

1. SB (MKx~Px is MKy~P)...i.e., S believes that x, something S remembers and knows, is y, something that S remembers, knows, but doesn't perceive
2. SB (Kx is ~K~My)
3. SB (~Kx is ~Ky)
4. SB (~Kx is Ky)
5. SB (Px is Py)
6. SB (Px is ~Py).
7. SB (~Px is ~Py)
8. SB (~Px is Py)
9. SB (MKPx is MKPy)
10. SB (MKPx is Ky)
11. SB (MKPx is Py)
12. SB (~K~Px is ~K~Py)
13. SB (~K~Px is ~Ky)
14. SB (~K~Px is ~Py)

**Possible Misidentifications**

15. SB (Kx is KPy)
16. SB (Kx is ~KPy)
17. SB (KPx is KPy)
