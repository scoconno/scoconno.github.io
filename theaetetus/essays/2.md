**NB: All prompts concern some part of *Theaetetus* 187a--201c**

## Introduction

Recall the goal of this course: there are often different plausible interpretations of the same text. You will learn by the end of this course that texts can be read in different ways and learn how to adjudicate different interpretations. Each of the essays in this course will focus on these skills. 

## Prompts

Write a question on one of the following prompts: 
1. Explain two interpretations of the Wax Tablet model. Which interpretation makes best sense of Socrates' objection to the model?  
2. Explain two interpretation of the Aviary model. Which interpretation makes best sense of Socrates' objection to the model?
3. Compare and contrast two interpretations of the way the Jury example is meant to refute the thesis that knowledge is true belief.

**NB: Include the prompt at the beginning of your paper.**

## Tasks

In order to complete this essays, do the following:
1. **Identify academic source(s) that explain these two interpretations.** 
	1. Find either one source per interpretation, or find one source that explains both thoroughly. 
	1. In order to identify these sources, you can start with the bibliography in the commentary and the sources I include in the book. Note that **encyclopedia entries and random internet website are not academic sources**. I expect you to discuss this with me if you are confused. 
	
2. Devote 1--2 pages explaining each interpretation in turn.
