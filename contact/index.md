## For Students 
If you are enrolled in a course, please use the Blackboard messaging app. That app allows me keep track of all messages for a particular course and is easier to use than email. It also allows me to easily comply with the Federal Law concerning the privacy of student education records (FERPA).

If you are not currently enrolled in my course,  email is the only way to contact me. Do not telephone the office. They will not give you my private number and I am unlikely able to take your call in my office. I will not reply to voicemails. 

Please check the syllabus before contacting me. If it is covered in the syllabus, I likely won’t respond. If you would like a response, please adhere to these basic etiquette guidelines:

+ If you must use email, use your NJCU email account. To comply with Federal Law I will not respond to non-NJCU email addresses. 
	+ Find out how to set up your NJCU email on iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch [here.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-iPhone-iPad-or-iPod-Touch-b2de2161-cc1d-49ef-9ef9-81acd1c8e234#BKMK_WorkOrSchool)
	+ Find out how to set up your NJCU email on an Android phone or tablet [here.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-an-Android-phone-or-tablet-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872#BKMK_O365SetUp) 
+ Keep the body of your message brief and to the point. If it’s longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead.
+ Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure.
+ Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentence.  Avoid text-speak and emoticons. 
+ Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor’s name]).
+ End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name.
+ Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example.

Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing.
