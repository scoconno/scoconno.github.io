I am currently on sabbatical and won't be responding regularly to emails while I take this time away to focus on research. If you are a student, or if you have any questions or requests related to the Department of Philosophy & Religion, please write to Dr. Sabine Roehr at sroerh@njcu.edu. Otherwise, I'll be in touch when I return. Thank you for your support and understanding.
