### Introduction

Such gall! Your so-called friend, Sam, borrowed fifty dollars from you over six months ago and is refusing to repay. He was in a bind, so you were happy to help. But he is now flush and needs to make you whole. Yet, in true Sam fashion, he has a philosophical argument that he claims shows that he owes you nothing. According to him, the person who borrowed money from you 6 months ago is not the person you call Sam today. The hair lengths are different. The skin of today's Sam is sunburnt, but the person who borrowed that money was not sunburnt. Today's Sam is also fit, healthy, happy, and employed. The person who borrowed from you is none of these things. 

Arguing with Sam in person never gets you anywhere. An email is best. In your email, you examine his argument and try prove that the Sam from today is, in fact, the very man who borrowed that money from you six months ago. You explain to him the difference between numerical identity and qualitative similarity, and use the psychological continuity theory to show how the Sam from today is identical to that earlier borrower despite their qualitative differences. 

### Purpose 

The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others.

3.  Understanding the difference between qualitative similarity and numerical identity. 

### Task

2. Solve this puzzle by using the psychological continuity theory. 
	+ **NB:** This assignment is not asking you to discuss each possible response to the puzzle. Only discuss the psychological continuity theory. Failure to ignore this instruction will result in a loss of points.
