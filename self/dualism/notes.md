## Mind as Immaterial Substance 

What is it to have a mind? If we asked Plato or Aristotle, two Greek philosophers living c.2500 years ago, they would answer that to have a mind is to have a soul. The English word 'soul' translates the Greek work 'psuche' and the latin word 'anima'. You likely recognize 'psuche' if you are a psychology major; 'psychology' roughly translates as 'the science of soul'. Psychologists today do not think that what it is to have a mind is to have a soul, but it is worth thinking about why our predecessors associated soul and mind. We'll do that by focusing on the 17th century philosopher Descartes (1596-1650), who is closely associated with the view. Descartes is such a central figure in the history of philosophy, mathematics, and physics that it is worth sharing a few biographical details with you. Here is a picture: 

![image](Descartes.jpg)


He was born in La Haye in the Touraine region of France. In 1606 or 1607, he entered the Jesuit College of La Fleche, where he remained until 1614 or 1615. He spent five to six years studying classical Latin, Greek, the major poets and orators (e.g., Cicero). This was followed by three years of philosophical training based on the philosophy of Aristotle, where he studied logic, morals, physics, and metaphysics. He also spent significant time on mathematics. Before joining the army, he also studied to be a lawyer. In 1629, he settled in the Netherlands in 1629  where he had one daughter (Francine) by a  servant (Helene). In 1649, he moved to Sweden to instruct Queen Christina in philosophy. They met at five in the morning for five hours three days a week. He died of respiratory infection on Feb. 11th, 1650.

That is some life! He is considered a polymath, a person who has expertise in many different fields. He was also very famous for his radically independent mind, which is illustrated by how deeply skeptical he was of the received learning of him time:  
> From my childhood they fed me books, and because people convinced me that these could give me clear and certain knowledge of everything useful in life, I was extremely eager to learn them. But no sooner had I completed the whole course of study that normally takes one straight into the ranks of the ‘learned’ than I completely changed my mind about what this education could do for me. For I found myself tangled in so many doubts and errors that I came to think that my attempts to become educated had done me no good except to give me a steadily widening view of my ignorance! (Discourse, I.2)

Descartes' skepticism motivated him to reexamine many central tenants in mathematics, optics, and physics. Not only did he identify mistakes in these areas, he radically changed our understanding of them. One commentator writes: 

> Descartes went far beyond the Copernican hypothesis that our Sun lies at the center of the universe with the Earth moving about it. He contended that the Earth is one among many planets, revolving around many different suns distributed throughout the cosmos. He further proposed that the whole universe is made of one kind of matter, which follows one set of laws. He invented the concept of a single universe, filled with matter having a few describable properties and governed by a few laws of motion. While others, including ancient atomists and Stoics, had sketched part of this new picture, Descartes’ vision of a unified physics governed by a few laws of motion was far richer and more detailed. Its combination of breadth and unity was unprecedented in his earlier work with Beeckman, or in the works of Copernicus, Galileo, or Kepler. This unified vision set the framework for Newton’s subsequent unification of mechanics and astronomy.” (Hatfield (2003), 18)


## Descartes' substance dualism

Our interest is Descartes' contributions to the philosophy of mind, most especially his argument for substance dualism. His argument is so famous that the position is also called 'Cartesian Dualism' after Descartes. His view can be summarized with the following four claims:  

1. There are substances of two fundamentally different kinds in the world, mental substances and material substances—or minds and bodies. The essential nature of a mind is to think, be conscious, and engage in other mental activities; the essence of a body is to have spatial extensions (a bulk) and be located in space.
2. A human person is a composite being of a mind and a body.
3. No mind is identical to a body.
4. Minds and bodies causally influence each other. Some mental phenomena are causes of physical phenomena and vice versa. (see Kim, p.34)

The fourth claim is important. Descartes thinks that there is causal interaction between mind and body. We'll ultimately worry whether 1 and 3 are compatible with 4, but let's first review what these claims mean and why Descartes accepts them.  


## Substance
Descartes believes that there are two kinds of substances, mental and physical ones. But what does Descartes mean by 'substance'? For our purposes, 'substance' is closely connected with another Greek word, 'hupokeimenon', which means roughly 'what underlies'.  It is used to describe that which possesses qualities, quantities, relations, and activities, but it is not itself possessed by anything else.  We will say that qualities, quantities, relations, and activities *inhere* in substances, where P inheres in S if S somehow possesses or has P, e.g., the color purple inheres in my water bottle because the bottle has that color, my sitting inheres in me because I am doing that sitting, etc. 

Substances are different from what inheres in them. For instance, the weight of the stone is different from the stone itself. The motion of the molecule is different from the molecule itself. Motion and weight belong to these substances, but they are not themselves substances. In contrast, the molecule and the stone are substances because they are subjects in which other things inhere but do not themselves inhere in anything else, e.g., the stone is  not a property of anything else, but other things are properties of it.

This contrast between substances and what inheres in them obviously resembles a linguistic contrast between grammatical subjects and predicates, between 'Flipper' and 'swimming' in the sentence 'Flipper is swimming'. But the contrast is more fundamental than the linguistic one. The word 'swimming' could also serve as a grammatical subject, e.g., 'swimming is a pleasant activity'. The word 'Flipper' could also serve as a predicate, e.g., 'the toy belongs to Flipper'. But substances can never inhere in anything else; they can never be possessed by anything else. They are the fundamental bedrock for everything that inheres in them.

Now that we have clarified what the word 'substance' means, let us discuss the phrase 'kind of substance'. Reality comprises dolphins, chairs, trees, atoms, molecules, and many more things beside these. By 'kind of substance', philosophers want to say that apparently disparate substances share some fundamental feature. For instance, many think that all substances are physical substances. By this, they mean that all substances possess physical properties. If this were right, then trees, clouds, dolphin, and molecules share one important feature---they are all physical substances, where being physical means that they all possess physical properties like having a weight, a location, etc. If there were only physical substances, then every substance--every subject in which properties inhere--would be a substance that possesses physical properties. We could never find, on this view, a substance without physical properties. 

This is not Descartes' view. He argues that reality comprises two radically different kinds of substances, physical (or bodily) substances, and souls (mental substance). These substances have very different features inhering in them. Souls, which for Descartes are just minds, are subjects not of physical properties, but of non-physical properties like thinking, sensing, judging, and willing. He believes that these properties inhere in mind, but do not inhere in bodies. Bodies, on the other hand, are extended in space, have weight, undergo nourishment, etc. But, according to Descartes, these properties do not inhere in the mind. Hence, there are two types of substances, bodies and minds. Each type of substance is a subject in which properties inhere, but the properties that inhere in them are radically different. 

It is important to recognize just how different these two types of substances are. A soul is simple, divine, and immutable. Our bodies are composite and perishable. A soul also seems something that can survive bodily death and decay. A body cannot survive its decay. This shouldn't be that surprising. That which inheres in a substance cannot exist without substances. Color cannot exist without some object that has color. Substance, on the other hand, does not depend for its existence on anything it inheres in. Socrates does not need to inhere in anything for him to exist. Descartes himself wrote: 

> The notion of a substance is just this—that it can exist by itself, that is without the aid of any other substance.

So, just as some chairs could exist without one another, so too a mind and body could exist without one another. 

## Descartes' argument for substance dualism

If Descartes is right, you are composed of two different substances, a physical one and a mental one. Your mind, which Descartes calls the soul, plays one role. Your body plays another. It is your mind that does your thinking, dreaming, fearing, and wanting. It is your body that does your walking, sitting, and eating, etc. Substance dualism, then, is just the view that there exists both physical and mental substances; that you are composed of these two substances. But why accept dualism? What is Descartes' argument for his radical claim that reality comprises two very different kinds of substances? Understanding the argument requires that we understand some of his larger theoretical concerns and how he argued for them. I will discuss these first before outlining his argument for dualism. 

First, Descartes was worried about the prevailing sciences of the time. This was a time when scientists still sought to explain the motion of bodies by the so-called inherent tendencies of earth to move downward, air to rise upward, etc. Doctors still explained disease by appeal to various humors in the body. Descartes worried as to whether the various sciences of the day were making fundamental errors and suggested that we need to take stock: which of our sciences could really be trusted?  He undertook this project in several works, most importantly 'The Meditations.' He describes the project in this work to a friend as follows: 

> I will say to you, just between us, that these six Meditations contain all the foundations of my Physics. But, please, you must not say so; for those who favor Aristotle would perhaps have more difficulty in approving them; and I hope that those who will read them will unwittingly become accustomed to my principles, and will recognize the truth, before they notice that my principles destroy those of Aristotle. (Descartes, letter to Marsenne)

The first meditation begins by asking what can be clearly and distinctly perceived. By 'clearly and distinctly perceived', Descartes means something like infallible certainty. The thought is that if a proposition is true and we know that it is true, then we will clearly and distinctly perceive its truth. Whether humans have such a facility for identifying truths is an interesting question that we will need to set aside. But it is important to what follows that Descrates thinks that humans do have this ability; he will appeal to it in his  argument for substance dualism. 

Descartes' next step is to identify some means/tool that would allow him test all of his beliefs. He suggests skepticism and proceeds to identify which of his beliefs, if any, are immune from doubt given the strongest skeptical challenge. His basic idea is that if he can remain certain in a belief even when it is attacked from many directions, then that belief is a true one. It is akin to how a jury must be confident of the defendant's guilt despite all the arguments of the defense if they are to return a guilty verdict. If the defense makes them even slightly unsure of the defendant's guilt, they are required to return an acquittal. 

Descartes' first tries to identify a skeptical challenge that is sufficiently strong for this purpose, i.e., a challenge that will pertain to as many of his beliefs as possible. Some candidate challenges can be ruled out. For instance, skepticism about vision only allows us to test our beliefs about perceptible things. Descartes finally settles on the strongest skeptical challenge and then proceeds to reject whatever is open to the slightest doubt. He continues until he has found something certain that can withstand the skeptical challenge.

It will be useful to discuss in some more detail that skeptical challenge that Descartes rejects:  

1.  If I am occasionally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs, then it is possible that I am totally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs.
2.  I am occasionally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs.
3.  Thus, it is possible that I am totally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs.
4.  If I don’t know that I am totally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs, then I don’t know that O (where O is a proposition about perceptual objects).
5.  I don’t know that O.

The first premise states that if my perceptual capacities trick me on some occasions, then it is possible that they are always tricking me. If, for instance, a person see a green colored chair as red, then it is possible that their eyes always report the wrong colors. This happens, for instance, with certain types of color blindness. Premise 2 is clearly true. Consider driving on a long and empty road on a very hot day. There might appear to you water in the distance, but this is an illusion; your eyes are tricking you. There are many other examples. When you are sick, food may taste sweet that is not sweet. If you have been to a loud concert, you may hear a ringing sound the next morning that is not, in fact, occurring. Premises 1 and 2 entail premise 3: it is possible that each of my perceptual beliefs is false. 

Premise 4 says that you can only know, say, that the chair is purple if you can rule out the possibility that your eyes are not deceiving you. Think again of a jury: they can only confidently judge that the defendant is guilty if they can rule out the possibility that the defendant is being framed. Similarly, I can only trust what my eyes are telling me if I can rule out the possibility that they are malfunctioning. 

Now while 2 is true about some beliefs, it is not true about all. I occasionally make mistakes about small and distant objects, but I’m never mistaken about medium sized objects in front of me in good lighting. Since Descartes is looking for an argument that could test all his beliefs, and this argument tests only some beliefs, he searches for a stronger skeptical argument and ultimately proposes the following: 

1.  If I don’t know that I’m not being deceived by an evil demon, then I don’t know that P.
2.  I don’t know that I’m not being deceived by an evil demon.
3.  Thus, I don’t know that P.

By 'evil demon', Descartes has in mind a creature that is as powerful as God, but something that has evil intent. In particular, the demon wants you to have only false beliefs; it is determined to conceal the truth from you. Instead of an evil demon, contemporary philosophers use the example of a brilliant, but evil scientist. The scientist can manipulate a brain via a series of electrodes attached to a computer into creating false beliefs and experiences; a person connected to that computer could be tricked into believing they were on a beach sipping a cocktail when in fact they were in a cold laboratory connected to a computer. 

'P' is any proposition whatsoever; it is any possible object of belief. Premise 1 says that if you cannot rule out the possibility that you are being deceived, then you do not know P. For instance, can you rule out the possibility that right now you are really in a laboratory and that your experiences of sitting at a computer screen is in fact a false one, an experience created by some evil scientist manipulating your brain? Premise 1 says that if you cannot rule out this possibility, then you cannot know that you are sitting in front of a computer screen. Of course, you very well may be sitting in front of a computer screen. The point is about whether you can be certain that your belief is true. Unless you can rule out the possibility that you are being deceived, then you cannot know for sure that you are sitting in front of the computer screen (even if you are, in fact, sitting in front of that screen). 

This is a suitably strong challenge to test all of Descartes' beliefs, including his beliefs about space, time, etc. He will now proceed to search for those beliefs that he would know to be true even if this skeptical scenario obtained, i.e., he asks whether there might still be things he can be certain of even if he cannot rule out the possibility that there is an evil demon trying to deceive him. 

## I am thinking, therefore I exist

Descartes writes the following in the second Meditation: 

> I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.

Descartes first claims, ‘I exist’. There is nothing the evil demon could do to deceive him about this belief, i.e., the very fact that the demon would be deceiving him, proves that he, himself, would exist. Knowing that he exists is a good beginning, but we believe we know more than that. In particular, we believe we know what kind of things we are. Descartes agrees. He reviews his former beliefs about what kind of thing he is with the hope of identifying which of these beliefs can also withstand the skeptical challenge:  

Beliefs about his body
:   He has a body, arms, face, and so on.

Beliefs about his functions:
:   He takes nourishment, moves, senses, and thinks.

Many of these beliefs can be doubted. An evil demon could trick him into thinking he has a body when in fact he does not. An evil demon could trick him into thinking that he really moves when in fact he does not. But Descartes thinks that some beliefs cannot be doubted. Namely, he cannot doubt that he is a being that thinks, i.e., the evil demon  could never deceive one into thinking that one doesn’t think, or into thinking that one thinks when one doesn’t, in fact, think. 

Since we can be certain that we think, we might also be certain about some facts about thinking. For instance, Descartes claims that thinking involves doubting, understanding, affirming, refusing to affirm, desiring, having mental images, being aware of what comes from senses (even if the senses are being deceived). If we are certain that we think, then we can be certain that we do all the things that are involved in thinking. Thus, Descartes claims that he knows that he exists, he thinks, and that he affirms, desires, and so on.

## Substance Dualism Again

Descartes' “cogito” argument, “I think, therefore I exist”, convinces him that he can be absolutely certain that he exists and that he is “A thinking thing”, “a thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines and has sensory perceptions.” Since he knows he is a thinking being, he now asks whether this thinking being could be identical to a body, i.e., is it his body that is thinking or is his mind a separate substance from his body? He will argue that a thinking thing cannot be identical to a body and so will conclude that the body and mind are distinct from one another. All of his arguments turn on identifying some feature that the mind has but the body does not. In general: to show that X ≠ Y, all we need do is find a single property P such that X has P but Y lacks it, or Y has P but X lacks it. Such a property P can be called a differential property for X and Y. Refer to the textbook for a full discussion of the arguments below. Each turn on identifying a feature that the body has and the soul does not, or vice versa.   

#### Argument 1

1. I am such that my existence cannot be doubted.
2. My body is not such that its existence cannot be doubted.
3. Therefore, I am not identical with my body.
4. Therefore, the thinking thing that I am, that is, my mind, is not identical with my body.


#### Argument 2

1. My mind is transparent to me—that is, nothing can be in my mind without my knowing that it is there.
2. My body is not transparent to me in the same way.
3. Therefore, my mind is not identical with my body.

#### Argument 3

1. Each mind is such that there is a unique subject who has direct access to its contents.
2. No material body has a specially privileged knower—knowledge of material things is in principle public and intersubjective.
3. Therefore, minds are not identical with material bodies.

We are said to know something ''directly'' when the knowledge is not based on evidence, or inferred from other things we know. When knowledge is direct, like my knowledge of my toothache, it makes no sense to ask, “How do you know?”


#### Argument 4

1. My essential nature is to be a thinking thing.
2. My body’s essential nature is to be an extended thing in space.
3. My essential nature does not include being an extended thing in space.
4. Therefore, I am not identical with my body. And since I am a thinking thing (namely a mind), my mind is not identical with my body

#### Argument 5

1. If anything is material, it is essentially material.
2. However, I am possibly immaterial—that is, there is a possible world in which I exist without a body.
3. Hence, I am not essentially material.
4. Hence, it follows (with the first premise) that I am not material.

#### Argument 6 

1. Suppose I am identical with this body of mine. 
2. In 2001 this body did not exist. 
3. Hence, from the first premise, it follows that I did not exist in 2001. 
4. But I existed in 2001. 
5. Hence, a contradiction, and the supposition must be false. 
6. Hence, I am not identical with my body.
