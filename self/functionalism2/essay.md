## Introduction

Turing believed that only beings that were able to pass the Turing Test were able to think. Searle objected that a being could pass the test and lack the ability to think. One way to adjudicate this disagreement is to examine the depiction of artificial intelligence in movies and TV shows. For this assignment, you will discuss what you think is the most advanced artificial intelligence in either a movie or TV show and present Turing and Searle's opposing positions. 


## Task

In your paper, you must do the following four things: 

1. Identify the relevant TV show or movie. Describe the artificially intelligent character. Is it a robot? An operating system? What is the movie/TV show about and what role does this character have in it? 
1. With reference to your chosen character, explain the claim that only beings that are able to pass the Turing Test are able to think. 
2. With reference to your chosen character, explain Searle's objection to the claim that every being that passes the Turing Test is able to think. 
4. Pick a side! With reference to your chosen character, explain why you agree with your chosen side, i.e., if you agree with Searle, why do you agree with Searle? If you agree with Turing, why do you agree with Turing? 
	   

**NB:** Failure to complete any of these tasks will result in a loss of points.

## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
