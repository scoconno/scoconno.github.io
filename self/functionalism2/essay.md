## Introduction

Turing believed that only beings that were able to pass the Turing Test were able to think. Searle objected that a being could pass the test and lack the ability to think. One way to adjudicate this disagreement is to examine the depiction of artificial intelligence in movies and TV shows. For this assignment, you will discuss what you think is the most advanced artificial intelligence in either a movie or TV show and present Turing and Searle's opposing positions. 


## Task

Make a convincing case that your chosen AI would pass the Turing Test. Explain why Searle would think that passing this test does not entail your chosen AI is able to think. 


1. Identify the relevant TV show or movie. Describe the artificially intelligent character. Is it a robot? An operating system?  
1. Explain the Turing Test and provide evidence that your chosen AI would pass it. 
2. Explain Searle's objection and why he would deny that the fact your chosen AI passes the Turing Test entails that it is able to think. 


**NB:** Failure to complete any of these tasks will result in a loss of points.
