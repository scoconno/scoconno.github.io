## Introduction

Turing believed that being able to pass the Turing Test was both necessary and sufficient for being able to think. One way to evaluate this claim is to examine the depiction of artificial intelligence in movies and TV shows. For this assignment, you will discuss what you think is the most advanced artificial intelligence in either a movie or TV show. Since I have already assigned Blade Runner, you cannot use that movie for this assignment--either the original or recently releases sequel.  



## Task

In your paper, you must do the following four things: 

1. Identify the relevant TV show or movie. Describe the artificially intelligent character. Is it a robot? An operating system? What is the movie/TV show about and what role does this character have in it? 
1. With reference to your chosen character, explain the claim that being able to pass the Turing Test is a necessary condition for being able to think. 
2. With reference to your chosen character, explain the claim that being able to pass the Turing Test is a sufficient condition for being able to think. 
4. Set out the evidence that your chosen character would pass the the Turing Test. 
	   

**Important Notes**
1. Failure to complete any of these tasks will result in a loss of points. 
2. You must thoroughly explain Turing's claim that being able to pass the Turing Test is necessary and sufficient for being able to think. Watch the videos from the website and read my notes from this week and last week. Use your own examples. 


## Word Count

Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.


## Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

## Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

## Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

## Format
Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.
