I have spoken of 'physical features', but this could be more precise. Let us clean the view up by distinguishing objects, properties, and relations.  Physicalism claims that every true sentence refers to fundamental physical objects, properties, and relations, or to non-fundamental physical objects, properties, and relations, where the non-fundamental supervenes on the fundamental. For instance, the 'heart is pumping blood' refers to various non-fundamental things, and these non-fundamental things are as they are only in virtue of some fundamental entities being how they are, i.e., the heart is pumping blood only because there are some fundamental physical entities doing what they are doing. We will call facts about both these fundamental and non-fundamental things, 'physical facts'.  

For instance, if you learn some facts in your biology class, those facts you learned are physical facts. 



Why? Those facts are about physical entities and their relations, in this case non-fundamental physical entities and their relations. These are still physical entities because they are as they are because of the fundamental things that compose them.

This may seem surprising when applied to, say, economics. If physicalism is true, then every fact you learn in economics is a physical fact. These are likely non-fundamental facts, e.g., facts about demand for a product changing as its price drops will be a non-fundamental fact because it holds in virtue of some facts about the most fundamental physical entities.
