### Introduction

Listen to this interview with [Susie Mckinnon](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2670406429), who suffers from Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory. Autobiographical memories are also called episodic memories and personal memories; the memories that are used in formulating the psychological continuity theory. The psychological continuity theory cannot explain Susie's personal identity. Why? In your paper, do the following: 

1. Explain the **psychological continuity theory** of personal identity. **Note the following:**
	1. Do not discuss the same body or same soul theory of personal identity. Only discuss the psychological continuity theory. Failure to ignore this instruction will result in a loss of points.
	2. Carefully explain the difference between **episodic memories** and **factual memories.** Make sure to explain why the psychological continuity theory is formulated using episodic rather than factual memories. Use examples. 
2. Using very specific examples from the radio interview, explain why Susie McKinnon's lack of episodic memory poses a challenge to the psychological continuity theory. 
  +  **NB:** Your paper must demonstrate a proper understanding of the difference between qualitative similarity (qualitative identity) and numerical identity. Failure to do so will result in loss of points.     

**NB:** Failure to include either of these elements in your email will result in a loss of points. 


### Word Count

Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

### Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.
