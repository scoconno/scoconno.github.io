## Introduction

If Descartes is right, you are composed of two different substances, a physical one and a mental one. Your mind, which Descartes calls the soul, plays one role. Your body plays another. It is your mind that does your thinking, dreaming, fearing, and wanting. It is your body that does your walking, sitting, and eating, etc. Substance dualism, then, is just the view that there exists both physical and mental substances; that you are composed of these two substances. His view can be summarized with the following four claims:  

1. There are substances of two fundamentally different kinds in the world, mental substances and material substances—or minds and bodies. The essential nature of a mind is to think, be conscious, and engage in other mental activities; the essence of a body is to have spatial extensions (a bulk) and be located in space.
2. A human person is a composite being of a mind and a body.
3. No mind is identical to a body.
4. Minds and bodies causally influence each other. Some mental phenomena are causes of physical phenomena and vice versa. (see Kim, p.34)

In this handout, we will focus on two problems with Descartes's dualism, the first a problem with how Descartes argues for his view, the second a direct objection to the biew itself. 

## Problems with Descartes argument

Recall that Descartes argued for his view via what we called the cogit argument. The argument turned on the idea that it was impossible to be deceived into thinking that we exist when we do not, in fact, fact, i.e., the very fact that we are being deceived proves that we are there to be deceived. So, Descartes' “cogito” argument, “I think, therefore I exist”, convinces him of the following: 

> I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind (Second *Meditation*).

There are several problems with the Cogito. The most pressing is a concern about whether the argument assumes what it seeks to prove. Recall that Descartes argues as follows: 

1. I am thinking. 
2. Therefore, I exist.

The premise, 'I am thinking' seems to presuppose that the subject of the thought exists. Since the subject of the thought is 'I', the premise then assumes the conclusion, that is, it assumes that I exist. An argument that assumes what it is trying to prove is obviously circular. And recall that Descartes is supposed to be testing whether he can doubt his own existence. He is begging the question if he argues, ‘I exist, therefore I cannot doubt that I exist.’

We might try save Descartes by reformulating the argument in a non-question begging way:

1.  There is a thought
2.  Therefore,  I exist

The evil demon certainly cannot deceive us about whether there is thought, so we can be certain about the first premise. This argument also avoids begging the question in the way the argument above does not. However, the argument is invalid. We  cannot infer from the fact that there is someone doing P, that we are that person  doing P. Compare: 

1. There is swimming. 
2. Therefore, I am swimming.

We can infer that someone is *swimming* from the first premise, but we cannot infer that we are the person doing the swimming. Similarly, even if we can infer from the fact that a thought  exists that *someone* is thinking, we cannot infer that we are the ones thinking that thought. 

So, the main problem for Descartes is that his argument at most proves that someone exsts, but it does not prove that he is that existing person. 

## Problems with Causal Interaction

While the above objection focused on Descartes' method in arguing for substance dualism, there are independent reasons for thinking that substance dualism is problematic. Consider how the mind and body causally influence one another. Our decision to throw the ball causes our limbs to move. The cat biting our finger causes our mind to feel pain. But how does this mental causation work? Think of an easy case of causation, say the movement of a pool ball as it is struck by another. One pool ball brings about an effect in another pool ball by, in part, touching it. Does all causation involve contact? Contact requires surfaces, so if causation involves contact, how could the mind, which doesn't have a surface according to Descartes, touch the body that does have a surface? Descartes answers in his sixth Meditation as follows: 

> The mind is not immediately affected by all parts of the body, but only by the brain, or perhaps just by one small part of the brain.... Every time this part of the brain is in a given state, it presents the same signals to the mind, even though the other parts of the body maybe in a different condition at the time.... For example, when the nerves in the foot are set in motion in a violent and unusual manner, this motion, by way of the spinal cord, reaches the inner parts of the brain, and there gives the mind its signal for having a certain sensation, namely the sensation of a pain as occurring in the foot. This stimulates the mind to do its best to get rid of the cause of the pain, which it takes to be harmful to the foot.

So, Descartes identifies the pineal gland as the seat of the soul, as that place where the soul and mind directly interact. The soul causes the pineal gland to move some bodily fluids in the nerves; the various motions of this fluid apparently cause the bodily parts to then move. So, the soul does not directly cause the hand to move. The soul interacts with the pineal gland and it is the pineal gland that directly causes the hand to move. 

Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia challenged Descartes to explain:

> how the mind of a human being, being only a thinking substance, can determine the bodily spirits in producing bodily actions. For it appears that all determination of movement is produced by the pushing of the thing being moved, by the manner in which it is pushed by that which moves it, or else by the qualification and figure of the surface of the latter. Contact is required for the first two conditions, and extension for the third. [But] you entirely exclude the latter from the notion you have of the soul, and the former seems incompatible with an immaterial thing.

Here is the argument presented more formally: 

+ P1. For anything to cause a physical object to move, or cause any change in one, there must be a transfer of momentum from the cause to the physical object.
+ P2. If an object imparts momentum to another, it must have mass and velocity.
+ P3. An unextended mind outside physical space has neither mass nor velocity.
+ C. Therefore, an unextended mind cannot cause a physical body to move. 

The problem is an acute one. Descartes recognized that the soul cannot directly moved the body. So, he argued that the soul effects the pineal gland, which in turn moves the body. But that begs the question: how does the soul interact with the pineal gland? If the soul causes the pineal gland to do something, the soul must transfer momentum to the pineal gland. And it is as difficult to explain how the soul does that to the pineal gland as it is to explain how it might directly effect the rest of the body, i.e., if it cannot effect the body, then it should not be able to effect the pineal gland either.  

## Varieties of Dualism
Recall that Descartes thinks that the mind and body are discrete substances; they are each the subjects of various features and are not themselves features of anything else. On this view, we really do have minds. It is, if you like, a separate thing in itself with its own nature. 

While substance dualism receives little current support, a different form of dualism does have contemporary defenders. This different form of dualism is called property dualism. It denies that there are physical and mental substances; all substances on this view have physical properties. But it claims that there are, nevertheless, mental properties of physical substances. What does this mean? 

Consider the properties of being a bachelor and being an unmarried man. These are one and the same property. How about the property of having a shape and having a size? These are obviously distinct properties that co-occur together. Anything which has a shape has a size and vice versa. But they are not identical properties. Many today think that the mind is better characterized as properties had by some substance, in particular, properties had by the physical body we possess. Consider the mental property of 'being in a state of pain', or the activity like 'thinking about Descartes'. These are properties, understood broadly, that inhere in some substance, e.g., the brain. Whenever these properties occur in the brain, there is some other feature/property that occurs in the brain, i.e., some c-fibre fires when you experience pain. 

What is the relationship between these physical and mental properties? Are they identical just as the properties of being a bachelor and being an unmarried man are identical? Or are they distinct like shape and size are distinct? 

While many deny that the mind is a non-physical substance, there are still those who argue that mental properties and physical properties are distinct, that a C-fibre firing and the feeling of pain are numerically distinct (even if they always occur together). So even if substance dualism is no longer in favor, the question about whether the mind and body are still somehow distinct is very much a live one. That question has become this: are mental properties numerically distinct from physical properties? Or are there only physical properties?
