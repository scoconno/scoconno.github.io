## Introduction

Some children have apparent memories of past lives, which is seen by some as as evidence for reincarnation. If reincarnation exists, then human beings are something much more than a body; they can change bodies as if they were changing their clothes. As such, reincarnation seems to provide evidence for Descartes' substance dualism. For this assignment, you will provide details from the below podcast about children who seem to remember past lives, and you will discuss how it provides support for Descartes' position. You will also explain how Princess Elisabeth would object to these apparent cases of reincarnation.
