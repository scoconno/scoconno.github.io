### Introduction

It is a live question what animals, if any, have consciousness, and, if any do, what that consciousness might be like. In your signature assignment for this course, you will put forward as forcefully as you can an argument that some animal of your choice does have consciousness. 

### Task

Your paper must include the following parts:     

1. Explain what you take to be most important feature of consciousness, e.g., phenomenal consciousness, or self-consciousness, or the neural correlates of consciousness, etc. These are just a few possibilities. More are discussed [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/).   
2. Explain why, according to you, this is the most important feature of consciousness. 
3. Identify some animal that you think has this feature of consciousness. Provide ample evidence that this creature does have consciousness in this way. 
4. Consider one objection to your claim that your chosen creature is conscious in the way described. 
5. Respond to this objection. 

### Further Instruction 

1. Failure to address any of these tasks will result in a loss of points. 
2. The encyclopedia entry [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/) offers an introduction to the topic. Identify 2-3 readings that seem interesting to you and pursue them.  
3. You will research your chosen animal. You can ask a librarian for help if you are unable to find relevant material. 
4. Include citations and a full bibliography. Pick your favored citation style. 


### Word Count

The body of your essay must be 1000--1250 words long. Essays shorter than 1000 words or longer than 1250 words will lose points. The bibliography, header, etc., does not count towards the word count. 

### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record. 

### Due Date
Please consult the syllabus for the due date.

### Late Submissions

Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early. 

### Format
Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.
