Welcome! My name is Dr. Scott O'Connor, and I'll be your instructor for this course. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in fall, 2014. Before my arrival, I received a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are ancient philosophy and metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website. 

While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O'Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No 'hey', 'yo', 'what's up', smiley face, etc. See [contact](/contact) for further information.

## Mechanics
Refer to the syllabus each week for the assigned readings. You will find it under 'syllabus' in Blackboard.

### Blackboard
There is a dedicated module for each week. You will find these under 'weeks' in Blackboard. In the module for each week, there are two types of links:  

1. Materials
2. Essays and Quizzes  

The materials link will take you to a dedicated page for the week's topic. It contains extensive notes, which you should read thoroughly. I also include readings not in the textbook. Since some of the material is tricky, I try to include some combination of short stories, videos, and podcasts. The assignment links are self-explanatory.  

### Work Schedule
Taking an online course is a lot of fun, but it also requires care. Compared to an in-person course, you have far more ownership over your time. You get to choose when to study and how to study, and, in some respects, you are on your own (though I'm here as a guide). Nevertheless, I recommend the following work schedule for each week: 

1. Read the assigned pages from the textbook (or the relevant papers). On this first read, skim and get the basic idea. Don't stress if you struggle to understand the material on this first read. 
2. Read my notes. 
3. Read the short stories, watch the videos, listen to the podcasts (whatever I have assigned). 
4. Re-read the assigned pages for the week. This time read them carefully and take detailed notes. 
5. If my notes and the supplementary material do not answer any of your questions, send me a message through Blackboard. Do this within two days of an assignment deadline if you want an answer to help with the assignment. 
6. Complete the assignments. You will have about one week for each assignment. No late work is accepted. No make-ups are offered. See my note on this below.



## Textbook
Please find details about the textbook on the syllabus. I will photocopy some readings for weeks 1, but you will need the textbook from week 2 onwards. The book is available online and in the campus bookstore. The textbook I chose is a compromise between quality and price. Some others are easier but more expensive. This means that some of the chapters in this textbook are less accessible than I would like. I will remedy this by providing supplemental reading and videos on the website. 

## Late work and make-ups
Students sometimes ask to submit work late or ask for a make-up opportunity. I used to receive many of these requests and found it difficult to adjudicate them. Since I want to treat my students equally, I found myself frustrated by students who expect special treatment. But, students do get sick and life does get in the way. So, here is what I do instead of accepting late work and offering make-ups: there are two options for module 5. You only need to complete one option. However, if you missed any assignments, you can complete both Module 5a and Module 5b.  

If you are still unable to complete the required number of assignments due to illness, personal problems, etc, then you should withdraw from the course. NJCU also offers medical withdrawals for students who miss the ordinary withdrawal dates. So, moral of the story: I will teach you the material and help you complete the assignments, but I will not entertain requests for make-ups or accept late work. I have built flexibility into the syllabus. So, please don't ask for more than that.  


## Technical Help

All Blackboard activity is recorded. I see when you log on, what you click, and how long you stay on the pages you click. Blackboard outages are rare and are automatically reported to me. If you encounter technical difficulties, the most likely source will be a difficulty with your browser or computer. Do take a moment to ensure your browser is up to date. If you are uncertain how to use Blackboard or have some technical difficulty, please consult NJCU's online learning resources here: [https://www.njcu.edu/academics/online-learning/enrolled-students](https://www.njcu.edu/academics/online-learning/enrolled-students)

I occasionally have students report that their computer crashes one minute before an assignment is due. My response is always the same: it is your responsibility to ensure that you are using a reliable computer on a stable internet connection. If your computer crashed one minute before an assignment is due, I encourage you to reflect on whether leaving the assignment to the last minute was a responsible strategy. 


## Next Steps 

1. Read the syllabus carefully. Course policies vary by professors, sometimes significantly. I don't allow make-ups, but other professors do. You need to understand the policies that govern this course and understand what is required of you.  

2. Read my introduction to the course content. 

3. Familiarize yourself with Blackboard and the course website.

3. Contact me if you have questions about the policies.
