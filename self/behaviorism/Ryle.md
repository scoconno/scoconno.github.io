Behaviorism: Ryle & the ghost in the machine
If dualism is wrong, then what is a mind? Ryle (a mid-20th century British philosopher) blames Descartes for putting us on the wrong track by assuming that the mind is a thing. Ryle’s main idea: the mind-body problem dissolves once we realize that our mental concepts/language really pick out distinctive patterns of human behavior, not properties of
       
some mysterious non-physical entity.
Ryle in Chalmers, p. 3 & ch 5 Kim, ch 3, pp. 55-63


Behaviorism: what's wrong with it
But there are powerful arguments against the behaviorist proposal that having a mind is at bottom simply a matter of our having certain behavioral capacities and dispositions. Putnam in Chalmers, ch 7
Kim, ch 3, pp. 63-78

Ryle could be good for a week!


“I have already had occasion to argue that a number of words which we com- monly use to describe and explain people’s behavior signify dispositions and not episodes. To say that a person knows something, or aspires to be some- thing, is not to say that he is at a particular moment in a process of doing or undergoing anything, but that he is prone to do certain things, when the need arises, or that he is prone to do and feel certain things in situations of certain sorts.
This is, in itself, hardly more than a dull fact (almost) of ordinary grammar. The verbs ‘know’, ‘possess’ and ‘aspire’ do not behave like the verbs ‘run’, ‘wake up’, or ‘tingle’; we cannot say ‘he knew so and so for two minutes, then stopped and started again after a breather’, ‘he gradually aspired to be a bishop’, or ‘he is now engaged in possessing a bicycle.”’ (Concept of Mind, 116)


"To be in a dispositional mental state is to be disposed, or prone, to do and feel certain things in certain circumstances. Since beliefs are dispositional states, we should be able to analyze belief in terms of dispositions to do and feel things. This appears to be an analysis of a large class of mental properties.
