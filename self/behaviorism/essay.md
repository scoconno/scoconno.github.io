### Introduction

What a case! You have never seen one like it in all these years of  working for the Gothic Knight Law Firm. A gorilla called Koko? Your clients want you to petition the courts for emancipation. That will be tough. You need to convince the courts that keeping Koko in captivity is as bad as keeping a human being in captivity. The case raises all kinds of tricky philosophical issues, but you settle on a strategy. Logical behaviorism is a theory of mind that shows Koko to have a mind as much as any human being does. You first need to take a careful note of behaviors that most resemble those of a human being. Observation in hand, you can then use use logical behaviorism to prove that she has a mind.

### Task

Write the **legal brief** to the court. You can find a sample legal brief [here](http://www.law.cuny.edu/legal-writing/students/memorandum/memorandum-3.html). Include four sections and include the titles of these sections (you can make up the laws for this essay) as follows:

1. Question: what is the case about? One sentence. 
2. Short Answer: A one sentence summary of your case. 
3. Facts: A detailed list of *some* of Koko's most human like behaviors, i.e., bodily movements and physical responses.  
	1. NB: Behaviors are bodily movements and physical responses. If you describe Koko's behaviors by using mental terms, you will have failed this part of the assignment. For instance, if you say that Koko was happy when she saw the cat, then you will have used the word 'happy', which is not a word for a bodily movement or physical response. Describe only the movements and responses.
1. Discussion: this should have two parts:
	1. An explanation of logical behaviorism and the argument for it.   
	2. An application of this theory to Koko and her behavior (which you outlined in the 'facts' section.)
	   

**NB:** Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will result in a loss of points. 


### Word Count

Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.



### Plagiarism

Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts---it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.
