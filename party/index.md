![image](pirate.jpeg)


Finley is turning 4! Please join us for a Halloween birthday party. 

+ Location: Pavilion, Congers Lake Memorial Park, 6 Gilchrest Rd, Congers, NY 10920
+ Time: October, 31st, 2021, 10:00am
+ Dress code: ghosts, monsters, and all things that go bump in the night. 
+ Covid related: I hope this is the last birthday party Covid forces us to hold outside. To ensure everyone's safety, we will be providing single servings of candy, treats, drinks, etc. Unlike last year, we feel sufficiently comfortable to forego masks while outdoors. 

We will meet under the pavilion. Please park near the dog run. See the below image:
