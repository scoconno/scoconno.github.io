**Zombies*
A philosophical zombie or p-zombie in the philosophy of mind is a hypothetical being that is indistinguishable from a normal human being except that it lacks conscious experience, qualia, or sentience. For example, if a philosophical zombie was poked with a sharp object it would shout and run around, but it would not feel any pain sensation. Nevertheless, it will behave exactly as if it does feel pain (it may say "ouch", recoil from the stimulus, and say that it is in pain).

Philosophical zombies are not merely behaviorally indistinguishable from a human. It has a human brain which generally physiologically indistinguishable from a human's brain. 

“In the latter, there are creatures exactly like you and me in all physical respects, behaving just as we do (including making noises like “That toothache kept me awake all night, and I am too tired to work on the paper right now”), but they are zombies with no experience of pain, fatigue, sensing green, or any of the rest. Their inner lives are dark and empty Cartesian theaters.”

Use Blade Runner again---really is a phenomenal book. 

According to physicalism, all that exists in our world (including consciousness) is physical.
Thus, if physicalism is true, a metaphysically possible world in which all physical facts are the same as those of the actual world must contain everything that exists in our actual world. In particular, conscious experience must exist in such a possible world.
In fact we can conceive of a world physically indistinguishable from our world but in which there is no consciousness (a zombie world). From this (so Chalmers argues) it follows that such a world is metaphysically possible.
Therefore, physicalism is false. 

## How do you know you are not a zombie? 

+ Acts of awareness vs objects of awareness. 
+ The object of awareness are of three types: 
	+ Object awareness, o-awareness
	+ Property awareness, p-awareness
	+ Fact awareness, f-awareness

You and the zombie are aware of the same world. You are o-aware of the pumpkin, p-aware of orange, and f-aware that the pumpkin is orange. So both zombie and non-zombie experience the same world. You differ from the zombie in that the zombie is not aware that it experiences the world. You are aware that you are experiencing the world. Our question is what o, p, or f awareness this awareness of your experience might consist of.  of that 

> What is it about this world that tells you that, unlike a zombie, you experience it? What is it you are aware of that indicates you are aware of it? (Dretske) 

Examine any content you are aware of. What is in that content that allows you know that you are aware of it? Try! All you will report is the world that you experience. But there must be something more. The zombie too experiences the world. They just aren't aware that they are. 

Perhaps you will response and say that the content of the states is something other than the world. 

> What is it that tells you that what you feel in your tooth is something you feel in your tooth, something you are actually aware of, and not the sort of thing that can occur, without being felt, in the tooth of a zombie? (Dretske)

+ If pain is a conscious mental state, there is an object of the awareness and an act of awareness. 
+ The object of the awareness is a bodily condition. 
+ The pain is your awareness of this bodily condition, i.e., pain is akin to perceiving your bodily condition. So you are o-aware of your body and p-aware of one of its conditions.  
+ Zombies have bodily conditions and can perceive their bodily conditions in the way that they can see the car drive by. 
+ Zombies are not aware that they are are experiencing their bodily conditions.
+ We are aware that we are experiencing our bodily conditions--but what is it that we are o or p aware such that being aware of o or p make us aware of our pain and is an awareness not available to the zombie. 
Representation:something that represents something (either itself or something else)goes proxy; stands for; symbolizes somethingrefers to something; is accurate/inaccurate; is true/false

EXAMPLES OF REPRESENTATIONAL KINDSPictorial Representation Linguistic Representation Mental Representation

1. How does a representation represent? Resemblance2. Are some kinds of representation more fundamental than others?Pictorial representation Linguistic representation



Resemblance is neither necessary nor sufficient for representation Not necessary: pictures can represent non-existent objects but theycannot resemble non-existent objectsNot sufficient: everything resembles something but not everything represents something

How does the string of symbols 'the cat is on the mat' come torepresent a particular situation—viz. the cat's being on the mat?


“So the kind of approach being described is also an externalism about qualia—qualia are the properties that external objects are represented as having and hence they are the properties of these objects when the representation is correct or accurate.”

“This position, which locates qualia out there in the world, would enable us to reject qualia as privately introspectible qualities of inner experi”

“what makes them qualitative states, states with qualia, is the fact that they represent the things they represent.”

“But according to the qualia externalist-representationalist, we have been misled into looking in the wrong place—we are trying to peek into a bat’s mind to see what qualia are lurking in it. The idea is not just hopeless but incoherent.”

“The qualia externalist tells us to look at the external environment of the bats and try to see what objects the bats are representing and what properties the bats are representing the objects as having. ”
**Argument for Representationalism**

1. Qualia are, by definition, the way things seem, look, or appear to a conscious creature.
2. If things ever are the way they look or appear, qualia are exactly the properties that the perceived or represented object has. If a perceptual experience represents an object to be F (for example, the object looks F to you), and if this experience is veridical (true to the facts), then the object is F.
3. Qualia, or phenomenal properties of experience, are among the objective properties of external objects represented in conscious experience.
