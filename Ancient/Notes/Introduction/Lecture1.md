    thinkers were contemporary with or even younger
    than Socrates)</span>

        maligned by Plato)–Gorgias, Protagoras, Melissus</span>

-   <span>Classical: 5th–4th Century BCE (centered around Athens)</span>

    -   <span>Socrates: 470/69–399 BCE (executed for impiety and
        corrupting the youth)</span>

        -   <span>Some people distinguish an “Imperial” period
            (corresponding to the time of the Roman Empire), containing

            thinkers mainly just advanced earlier

The Central Task of the Historian of Philosophy {#the-central-task-of-the-historian-of-philosophy .unnumbered}
===============================================

-   <span>Determine what view the historical figure is presenting</span>

-   <span>Determine what reasons the historical figure offers to commend
    that view</span>

-   <span>Determine why those reasons might have seemed to that figure
    to be good reasons to accept that view</span>

-   <span>Determine whether and why you agree or disagree with the
    view</span>

Methodological Principles {#methodological-principles .unnumbered}
=========================

-   <span>Ancient $\neq$ Dumb</span>

-   <span>Principle of Charity: If two interpretations are equally
    consistent with the text, attribute the more philosophically
    interesting view to the author.</span>

-   <span>Principle of Humility: Be humble in your approach to
    these texts. If you have an interpretation that attributes an absurd
    view to a thinker, you should suspect that you haven’t exactly
    figured out what the view is. These views (like all views) can be
    challenged, but must be challenged *respectfully*.</span>
