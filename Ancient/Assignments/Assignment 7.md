#### Prompt ####

In *Phys.* II. Ch. 1, Aristotle argues that nature is an internal principle of change and rest. He further argues that form rather than matter is this relevant principle.

1) Explain in your own words what Aristotle means by saying that nature is an internal principle of change and rest. Give examples to illustrate what a principle of change and rest might explain in the first place.  

2) Explain Aristotle's argument that form rather than matter is the nature of a thing. Make sure to briefly say what form and matter seem to be in this chapter. Also pay close attention to Aristotle's examples.
