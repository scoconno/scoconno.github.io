## Short Essay 1

### Prompt 

In the *Euthyphro*, Socrates rejects Euthyphro’s proposal that ''the pious is just what I’m doing now: to proceed against whoever does injustice…'' Imagine that you are Socrates. Explain in simple, modern English, the criteria for an adequate answer to a `What is X? question. Then explain why Euthyphro's proposal does not meet these criteria.


### Further Instruction 

+ This assignment asks you to write from Socrates' perspective. What does that mean? On the hand, you should not be writing phrases like 'Socrates thinks', or 'Socrates believes', etc. I'm asking you to imagine that you are Socrates and write as if you were him. 
+ Explain in the simplest way possible the criteria that must be satisfied to answer any question of the form ''what is X?''. Use examples. 
+ Note that while these criteria are not explicitly stated in the text, we can infer them from Socrates' rejections of Euthyphro's proposals. We will discuss this in class. See also the handout for this week. 
+ Make sure to explain why Euthyphro's suggestion fails each of the criteria. 
+ Write 250-500 words. No more. No less. 
+ Submit your responses by Mon. @ 1pm.
