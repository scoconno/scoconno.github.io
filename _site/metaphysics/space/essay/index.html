  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>What a challenge! You are a famed glove maker, the most famous alive today. But, NASA has a challenge for you. They have placed a 3D printer in a windowless room on the International Space Station. Nothing else is in the gravity free room.<br />
You’ve seen examples of these printers in videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8NFLWFrGxc">this</a>.</p>

<p>You must send instructions to that printer to create a left handed glove for an astronaut whose hands are perfect incongruent counterparts; there are no distinguishing differences between the two hands apart from the fact that one is a left hand and the other is a right hand.</p>

<p>Seems simple! You need to give that printer exact measurements and instructions about what order to build the glove parts, e.g., you’ll tell it how long each finger is, the distance between the knuckles on each hand, the color, etc. But how do you tell it to make a left handed glove as opposed to a right handed glove? There is no obvious up or down in this room since there is no gravity. The 3D printer cannot sense the sun because there are no windows.</p>

<p>This is the challenge NASA has given you. They will test your creation by sending the astronaut to the space station. If it fits on her left hand and not right hand, you win. If it fits on the right hand and not the left hand, you lose.</p>

<p>You always write detailed diary entries when working on a project. You detail the task, the challenges, and your solution.</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>Write your detailed diary entry. In the diary entry, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain the notion of ‘incongruent counterparts.’ What does it meant to say that the astronaut’s hands are perfect incongruent counterpart?</li>
  <li>Explain Internalism with respect to Incongruent Counterparts.</li>
  <li>Describe the internal/intrinsic features of a hand that might make it a left hand. This description is what will be sent to the 3D printer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>

<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>Submit your work by first clicking on the relevant assignment in Blackboard. Click on ‘browse computer’ and upload your document as a .doc, .rtf, or .pdf file. Please use ‘attach document’. Do not send it to me by e-mail or through Blackboard’s messaging application.</p>
