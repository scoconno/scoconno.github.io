  <p>title: What is Metaphysics?</p>

<p>What is Metaphysics?</p>

<p>The word ‘metaphysics’ is a neologism; it was the title that some editor gave to one of Aristotle’s works. In that work so titled, Aristotle engaged in what he calls ‘first philosophy’, which he also calls the ‘science of being qua being’. While the discipline of metaphysics has changed over time, it is useful in answering the question ‘what is metaphysics?’ to think about the project of first philosophy as Aristotle understands it. What is the science of first philosophy? There are different ways we might take it:</p>

<h2 id="the-science-of-what-really-exists">1. The Science of what Really Exists.</h2>

<p>Aristotle characterizes first philosophy as the most <em>general science</em>. One of understanding this claim is that metaphysics is concerned with distinguishing what kinds of things exist from those that do not. Do number, non-physical entities, for instance exist? What about God? Or what about macroscopic entities, entities that are apparently composed of microscopic entities? Do these things, things like chairs, tables, and so on, exist in addition to the parts that compose them. Similarly, we might ask whether the mind really exists or whether all there is is the firing of c-fibers.</p>

<h2 id="being-qua-being">2. Being qua Being</h2>

<p>As well as characterizing first philosophy as the most general science, Aristotle also construes it as the science that investigates being as such. It is the science that attempts to answer the question ‘what is being?’. This question is the same, Aristotle, thinks as the question ‘what it is for something, anything to be a being?</p>

<p>Imagine that you are looking at a dolphin. You ask what the thing in front of you is. A biologist will tell you about that being insofar as it is an organism. They’ll tell you about it’s peculiar behavior, it’s mating habits, and so on. A physicist looking at the same being will tell you about it not insofar as it is an organism, but insofar as it is physical being, a being that occupies space, is made of matter has weight, and is governed by various physical laws. The physicist could approach the study of that dolphin in a similar way to their study of stones. A biologist of course has nothing to say about stones at all.</p>

<p>Flipper is a dolphin, an animal, and a physical thing. But he is also one more thing. He is a being. A stone is also a being. Numbers, if they exist, are also beings. So too God if he exists is a being. Numbers and God are not, of course, physical entities. There’s not much a physicist can say about what it is to be a number. But if they do exist, then one thing that dolphins, stones, God and numbers have in common is that they are all beings. Metaphysics, first philosophy as Aristotle calls it, might be construed as the study of everything not insofar as it is a plant or an animal but simply insofar as it is a being. Metaphysics then attempts to answer the question ‘what is being?’ by determining what every existing thing has in common. These commonalities should explain why anything that is a being is a being. They also tell us what distinguishes the things that exist from those that do not exist.</p>

<h2 id="the-fundamental-level">3. The Fundamental Level</h2>

<p>This last point points to an alternative way of characterizing metaphysics: it is the study of the features that explain why things are beings. On this view, metaphysicians are not so much interested in what exists, but interested in which of the things that exist are fundamental—where this means that they explain why the non-fundamental beings exist. The ancient philosophy Thales, for instance, believes that</p>

<h2 id="non-empirical-claims-about-natures">4. Non-empirical claims about natures.</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, metaphysics has some affinity to physics. Aristotle wrote a different treatise, <em>The Physics</em>’. The ‘meta’ indicates that the relevant editor taught that <em>The Metaphysics</em> should be read either in conjunction with or after the text <em>The Physics</em>. One tempting option is to think that the editor believes that metaphysical questions are raised and answered only after physics is complete.</p>

<p>The relationship, in Aristotle’s mind, is likely more sophisticated. Aristotle believes that the proper object of physics is change and its attributes. Physics studies why and how objects are subject to change, studies the space within which change occurs, and also studies time, which Aristotle considers the measure of change. Aristotle thinks that if there were non-changing beings, then physics would be the most general science. If what it is to be a being is to change, then physics as the science of changing beings and change, would tell us everything we wish to know about being.</p>

<p>How do we know if everything is a changing being?</p>

<p>Physics assumes that the natural world exist. It tries to explain change, but it is not part of the physicists job to prove that there really is change in the world. Rather, once it is established that there is, they try explain it. Aristotle thinks that there are a variety of questions we can ask about the objects of physics that cannot be answered by physics, most importantly, questions which seem to undermine the very existence of change itself. So, for instance, Aristotle is concerned with certain paradoxes of motion which suggest that the appearance of moving things is a mere illusion; you may thing that there is walkings, cycling, and jumping, but you are suffering a massive hallucination.</p>
