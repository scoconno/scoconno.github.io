(PHEN) Anything that appears thus and so to someone, and anything that someone believes to be thus and so, is thus and so (i.e. all appearances and all beliefs are true);

(REL) Anything that appears thus and so to someone, and anything that someone believes to be thus and so, is thus and so for him (i.e. all appearances and all beliefs are true relative to the one who has them).


It is important to distinguish, as Aristotle does here, between the claim that ‘All appearances and all beliefs are true’ (phenomenalism) and t he claim that ‘All appearances and all beliefs are true relative to the person who has them’ (relativism). By ‘the things that appear to us’ (ta phainomena), he means, in particular, things as they appear to our senses, i.e. the contents of our sense perceptions; whereas by ‘the things that we believe’ (ta dokounta) he means in general things as we believe them to be, i.e. the contents of our beliefs in general. So there may be things that we believe (dokounta), but which are not things that appear to us (phainomena); for perhaps not all our beliefs are based on what we perceive through the senses, or based directly in what we perceive through the senses. But may there, likewise, be things that appear to us, but which are not things that we believe? Evidently, there may. For example, the tower may appear round to one’s sight, but one may not believe that it is round—if, for example, one is looking at it from a distance and one knows from experience that even square things may look round from a distance. So not all phainomena are dokounta.



(P1) Only if PNC is true of things can we think and speak about things;
but evidently,
(P2) We can think and speak about things; Therefore,
(C1) PNC is true of things.
(P3) PNC is not true of anything if, and only if, things are radically indeterminate.
C2) It is not the case that things are radically indeterminate.


But one may nonetheless argue that we can still think and speak about things, namely things as they appear to us and as we conceive them; so one may also accept his premise P2, on one understanding of it. This shows that there is a way of accepting the premises in Aristotle’s argument (i.e. P1, P2 and P3) while at the same time rejecting its conclusions (i.e. C1 and C2).

we can still think and speak about things as they appear to us and as we conceive them.

This, the phenomenalist and relativist will argue, is because there is a sharp distinction between, on the one hand, things as they appear to us and as we conceive them and, on the other hand, the things themselves

For what is distinctive of phenomenalism and relativism, as he characterizes these positions here, is that they draw a sharp distinction between, on the one hand, things as they appear to us and as we conceive them and, on the other hand, the things themselves.

We can think and speak of appearances, i.e. of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them.


ARISTOTLE ON PNC
 
Aristotle claims that without PNC there would be no distinction between and essence and accident.
 
Three versions of PNC
 

> It is impossible for the same thing both to belong and not to belong to the same thing at the same time and in the same respect. (1005b19–20)


This means the following: 

> for any object x, and any property F, it is not possibly the case that x is both F and not-F’ 

 
 

1. [4]  It is impossible that it should at the same time be true to say of the same thing both that it is human and that it is not human.
2. (1006b33–34)

The second version is as follows: “It is impossible to hold (suppose) the same thing to be and not to be (Metaph IV 3 1005b24 cf.1005b29–30).” Although this version is ambiguous as it stands, it is best understood as the claim that it is impossible to hold the same thing to be F and not to be F&c.
 
“opposite assertions cannot be true at the same time” (Metaph IV 6 1011b13–20)

 
 It is impossible for the same thing both to belong and not to belong to the same thing at the same time and in the same respect —and one may add any further qualification with a view to [answering] the dialectical difficulties.
(1005b19–20; see also 1011a34–b1
 
 if PNC is to be true, it must be understood to say that a property (e.g. redness or motion) cannot be both true of and not true of a single thing, in a more strict sense of ‘single’ or ‘unitary’ thing. For example, if PNC is to be true of the spinning-top, it must be understood to say that motion cannot at any particular time be both true of and not true of the very same aspect or part of the spinning-top, e.g. its circumference or its axis.
 
 So Aristotle, like Plato, argues that, if we at all want to defend the proposition that PNC is true of things and of all things, we need to investigate with particular care various ways in which things may or may not be unitary.
Three ideas
 
 
I want to start by introduction the notion of essence and accident. Get them to focus on the idea that there are essences and accidents that are independent of us. Then the question is how could we defend that.
 
Is the idea that the only defense is one that would require us to give up PNC? If there are no essences, then everything is attribute. Then everything is signifying about something.
 
 





We will see later that it is important to distinguish the question whether PNC is true with regard to statements (or only with regard to statements, or primarily with regard to statements) from the question whether PNC is true with regard to things. Evidently Aristotle thinks that PNC is true both with regard to statements and with regard to things. But he appears to be especially interested in the question of whether PNC is true with regard to things.



Let this, then, suffice to show that [A] the claim that contradictory statements cannot at once be true [i.e. PNC] is the most secure [bebaion] of all claims; and [B] what consequences are incurred by those who deny this claim; and [C] why those who deny it do so.
(1011b13–15)


We must show to them and convince them [i.e. the phenomenalists and those who defend this radical view about change] that there is a nature that is changeless [akinētos tis phusis].


1. the things themselves are radically indeterminate.
2.  Because the things themselves are radically indeterminate, PNC is not true of them.
3. Because PNC is not true of the things themselves, it is impossible to think or speak of the things themselves.
4.  But it is nevertheless possible for us to think and speak of things, even though it is impossible to think or speak of the things themselves; for we can still think and speak of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them.



In other words, to signify something at all, i.e. to think and speak about something at all, we must signify one thing as opposed to another: we must signify something determinate. But what does Aristotle mean when he says that if we are to think and speak about something at all, then we must think and speak of it as something determinate? He means that we must think and speak of it as being, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, F as opposed to not-F. For example, to think that clouds are something determinate is to think that a cloud, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, namely, a cloud, is condensed vaporous water, as opposed to something else. Or, in Aristotle’s example, to think that a human being is something determinate is to think that a human being, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, namely, a human being, is a two-footed animal, as opposed to something else (see 1006a31–34 and b13– 14; we may note that the content of the particular example does not appear to matter to him, for he hardly thinks that this, a two-footed animal, is what a human being essentially is). This is also what he means when he says that to think and speak of something is to think and speak of something as having an essence (see 1006b32–34); for in general when he says that the essence (to ti ēn einai) of a thing, x, is F, he means that the thing, x, is, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, F. (We will consider his conception of essence in a moment; see §8 of this chapter.)

PNC, which is a central principle of reasoning and rational thought, is true of things, and it is true of things simply in so far as they are beings—things that are.


But he defends this view more radically in IV. 5–6, when he argues against those—phenomenalists and relativists—who argue that PNC is true only of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them, and not true of the things themselves and of things without qualification. For he will argue (in IV. 5–6) that PNC is indeed true of the things themselves and of things without qualification; it is not only true of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them


He argues, on the one hand, that PNC is a necessary condition for the possibility of thought and language; but, on the other hand, that PNC is true of the things themselves and of things without qualification, it is not only and not primarily true of things in so far as we can think and speak of things.


Let us anticipate Aristotle’s solution to this striking puzzle. PNC is true of things as things appear to us and as we conceive them; for PNC is a necessary condition for the possibility of thought and language. But PNC is true of things as things appear to us and as we conceive them because it is true of the things themselves and of things without qualification. So PNC is primarily true of the things themselves and of things without qualification; and because of this, it is true of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them. In other words, PNC is a necessary condition for the possibility of thought and language; but what explains why thought and language is possible is, precisely, the things themselves and without qualification, and in particular that PNC is true of them.


For one may think that PNC is true because of the nature of statements, or thoughts expressible in statements, rather than because of the nature of things.

If so, PNC will be true of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them, and in general it will be true of things in so far as we can think and speak of things; but it may not be true of the things themselves and of things without qualification

The overall conclusion of the defence is that if PNC were not true of things, then it would be impossible to use thoughts or words to signify things, so it would be impossible to think or speak about things.


In other words, they defend views that they think imply the falsity of PNC, and he agrees that their views do indeed have this implication. As we will see, it is the following view in particular which both those who deny PNC and Aristotle think directly implies the falsity of PNC:
Things are radically indeterminate (aorista).


o both according to those who deny PNC and according to Aristotle, if things are radically indeterminate, then PNC will not be true of things — and in this sense PNC will be false. The difference between Aristotle and those who deny PNC, therefore, is over whether things really are radically indeterminate. Those who deny PNC think so, but Aristotle thinks not— he argues, on the contrary, that things are determinate (hōrismena). So the task that Aristotle sets himself is to argue against those who think that things are radically indeterminate, and so to defend PNC against those who want to deny it.

Rather, they claim that there actually are things that are both F and not-F; and they are ready to give examples of such things (see 1006b33–34). Even more radically, they claim that all things are both F and not-F:
The same view [i.e. that all things are both F and not-F] is also the source of Protagoras’ view.... For if [as Protagoras thinks] all beliefs and appearances are true, it is necessary that everything should be at once true and false.
(IV. 5, 1009a6–9) Heracleitus’ view, which says that all things are and are not [i.e. are F
and are not-F], makes everything true.
(IV. 7, 1012a24–26)

all things, with regard to every property F, are both F and not-F.


That is to say, it is hard to think that some things are radically indeterminate, without thinking that all things are radically indeterminate. Aristotle himself makes this important point (see 1008a11– 12). For suppose that only some things are radically indeterminate. But then we must ask, which things are they? Suppose that we identify something radically indeterminate, e.g. clouds or sub-atomic particles. Evidently, even if these things are not wholly determinate, they are not radically indeterminate; for they differ and can be distinguished from other things. We have, after all, just distinguished them from other things, i.e. from things that are not clouds or sub-atomic particles. Indeed, Aristotle will argue that a thing, unless it is radically indeterminate, differs and can be distinguished from other things above all because it is the determinate and well-defined thing that it is—because it has an essence—or because it
THE DEFENCE OF PNC 141
142 THE DEFENCE OF PNC
depends on something that is a determinate and well-defined thing and has an essence.

So, if this argument succeeds, it will establish not only that some things are determinate, but that all things are determinate. In other words, it will establish that, with regard to each and every thing, x, there is at least one property, F, such that x cannot be both F and not-F. This property, F, it will emerge, is the essence of x, i.e. that in virtue of which x is a determinate and well-defined thing in the first place.


We tend to conceive of PNC as the principle which says that no statement can be both true and not true. And we tend to think that PNC is a logical principle, both in the sense that it is about statements and in the sense that, if it is true, it is true because of the nature of statements.

As Aristotle formulates PNC, it says that one and the same property cannot both be true of and not be true of one and the same thing, at the same time and in the same respect. But now suppose that all things are so radically indeterminate that it is not possible to distinguish a particular respect in which a thing may be either F or not-F but not both F and not- F. To illustrate this, we may think of, for example, clouds. For a cloud may at the same time look both round and not round, and it may not be possible to distinguish a particular respect in which it is round and a different particular respect in which it is not round


This also shows something crucial, namely that to deny that PNC is true of a thing, one must argue that it is not possible to consider the
THE DEFENCE OF PNC 145
146 THE DEFENCE OF PNC
thing in one and the same respect—just as, apparently, it is not possible to consider a cloud in the single respect of its determinate shape.


In particular, he argues that whether PNC is or is not true of things depends on whether things are determinate (hōrismena) or indeterminate (aorista). This, above all, is the question that divides Aristotle from those who deny PNC.

Aristotle uses a variety of ways to indicate the contrast between the two views—the view that things are determinate and the view that things are indeterminate. For example, he also describes the disputant’s view as being that things are not unitary (1007b26), whereas his own view is that things are unitary (1006a31–4, b7–10); or as the view that things do not have an essence (1007a20–21), whereas his own view is that things have an essence (1006a32–34); or as the view that things are not definable, whereas his own view is that things are definable (1012a21f.; in general a definition of a thing is a true statement of its essence). So those who deny PNC think that the truth of PNC stands and falls with the view that things are determinate, unitary, in possession of an essence and definable; but what they think is just that things are not like that.


P1. PNC is not true of things if, and only if, things are indeterminate.
P2. If things are indeterminate, then it is impossible to think and speak about things.
P3. It is possible to think and speak about things. Therefore,
C. It is not the case that PNC is not true of things; i.e. PNC is true of things.


Aristotle, it appears, understands it to mean that we can think and speak about the things themselves, not just about things as they appear to us and as we conceive of them.


If he [the disputant] says nothing [i.e. if he really accepts that language is impossible], it is ridiculous to try to say something against one who does not have a statement to make about anything, in so far as he is like that; for such a person is to that extent already like a vegetable.
(1006a13–15)

ut what does Aristotle mean when he says that if we are to think and speak about something at all, then we must think and speak of it as something determinate? He means that we must think and speak of it as being, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, F as opposed to not-F. For example, to think that clouds are something determinate is to think that a cloud, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, namely, a cloud, is condensed vaporous water, as opposed to something else.


Or, in Aristotle’s example, to think that a human being is something determinate is to think that a human being, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, namely, a human being, is a two-footed animal, as opposed to something else (see 1006a31–34 and b13– 14; we may note that the content of the particular example does not appear to matter to him, for he hardly thinks that this, a two-footed animal, is what a human being essentially is). This is also what he means when he says that to think and speak of something is to think and speak of something as having an essence (see 1006b32–34); for in general when he says that the essence (to ti ēn einai) of a thing, x, is F, he means that the thing, x, is, simply in virtue of being the very thing it is, F. (We will consider his conception of essence in a moment; see §8 of this chapter.)


If we ask why Aristotle thinks that to think and speak about something is to think and speak about something determinate, the reason is,
THE DEFENCE OF PNC 149
150 THE DEFENCE OF PNC
apparently, that he thinks that to think and speak about something is to think and speak about one thing as opposed to another. In other words, when we think and speak about something (e.g. Socrates, which is Aristotle’s example, see 1007b5f.), we think and speak about it as opposed to anything else. So we must be able to indicate, or at least we must be willing to try to indicate, what distinguishes the thing that we are thinking and speaking about from other things. But to indicate this is, exactly, to indicate how the thing that we are thinking and speaking about is the determinate thing that it is.

So Aristotle thinks that if we are to think and speak about something at all, then we must think and speak of it as something determinate. He concludes that if we are to think and speak about something at all, then we must suppose that PNC is true of it (see 1006b28–34). The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows. Suppose that we are thinking and speaking about a cloud. Perhaps we will think that a cloud can be both round and not round; for it looks both round and not round, and there may not be a respect in which it is round and a different respect in which it is not round. But the question is this: can what we are thinking and speaking about be at the same time both a cloud and not a cloud? We have supposed that if we are to think and speak about a cloud at all, then we must think and speak about it as something determinate, for example, as condensed vaporous water. But then it, the very thing that we are thinking and speaking about, cannot at the same time not be condensed vaporous water; or else it would not be something determinate after all: it would not be it as opposed to something else. (Aristotle’s reasoning, at 1006b28–34 is about human beings, not clouds, but otherwise it runs along these exact lines.) So, on the supposition that to think and speak about things is to think and speak about determinate things, Aristotle concludes that PNC is true of things.


Aristotle has argued that we can think and speak about a thing, x, only if PNC is true of this thing, x. In particular, he has argued that we can think and speak about a thing, x, only if there is some property, F, such that x is F and x cannot at once be not-F. For it is in virtue of there being such a property that the thing, x, is a determinate thing in the first place; and if it were not a determinate thing, then we could not think or speak about it— for we would not think or speak about it as opposed to any other thing.

What does it establish? It is crucial to recognize that Aristotle thinks that it has established that we can think and speak about a thing, x, only if this thing, x, has an essence

For it is in virtue of having an essence that a thing, x, is a determinate thing in the first place; i.e. it is in virtue of having an essence that a thing is the very thing that it is, as opposed to any other thing. This means that Aristotle thinks that the defence of the view that PNC is true of things is at the same time a defence of the view that things have an essence. And this defence of the view that things have an essence is a truly radical defence. For it argues that unless things have an essence, we cannot think or speak about things.

Does it establish that the things themselves and without qualification have an essence or only that things as we conceive them have an essence? We will take up this central question in the next chapter.

This is above all because it was crucial in the defence that we can think and speak about a thing, x, only if x has an essence; for it is in virtue of having an essence that this thing, x, is the very thing that it is, as opposed to any other thing.

In particular, we can think and speak about a thing, x, only if there is some property, F, such that x is F and x cannot at once be not-F. So the conclusion is that, for any thing, x,
THE DEFENCE OF PNC 151
152 THE DEFENCE OF PNC
there is a property, F, such that x is F and x cannot at once be not-F. This property, it emerges, is the essence of this thing, x, i.e. it is that which determines what this very thing, x, is.

How can the claim that ‘With regard to its essence, E, a thing cannot be both E and not-E’ provide reason for thinking, as in Aristotle’s original aim, that ‘




First, part of the source of phenomenalism is, apparently, the observation that there is conflict among the sense perceptions of different people—and indeed of the same person at different times, or the same person at the same time but in respect of different senses (e.g. sight and touch). For example, the wine that tastes sweet to the healthy person tastes bitter to a person that is ill (see 1009b3–5; it is interesting to compare Plato’s Theaetetus, e.g. 166el-4). Indeed, there is conflict in general among the beliefs of different people. For example, people that are mad, or temporarily beside them selves, think thoughts and hold beliefs different from and conflicting with those of sane people (see 1009b4–6, b28–33). In short:


The fact that sense perceptions, and beliefs in general, conflict with each other may be part of the source of phenomenalism, but evidently it is not sufficient to generate phenomenalism. For perhaps there is a way, or ways, of determining which sense perceptions and beliefs are true and which are false. If there is such a way, or ways, we evidently need not conclude that all sense perceptions (or all appearances based on sense perceptions) and all beliefs are true. So we need not conclude that phenomenalism is true. But perhaps phenomenalism will emerge, if we think not only that sense perceptions and beliefs conflict, but that there is no adequate way of determining which sense perceptions and beliefs are true and which false, i.e. if we think that there is no criterion of truth with regard to sense perceptions and in general with regard to beliefs. So, in order to generate phenomenalism, we need to add:

In this way Aristotle points out that this claim (i.e. 3) is an important part of a line of reasoning in support of phenomenalism (see 1009b2f.).

But will phenomenalism emerge, even if we suppose that sense perceptions and beliefs conflict (i.e. 2) and that apparently it is impossible adequately to resolve such conflict (i.e. 3)? Aristotle points out an important reason for thinking that the combination of these two views (i.e. 2 and 3) is still not sufficient to generate phenomenalism. For even if, for example, some wine appears to some people to be sweet, but appears to other people not to be sweet, and even if apparently such conflict cannot be resolved, i.e. even if apparently we cannot know whether the wine itself really is sweet or not sweet, still we need not conclude that the wine is at once sweet and not sweet (i.e. the conclusion required by phenomenalism). For we may instead conclude that the wine itself is either sweet or not sweet, but not both; but that apparently we cannot know which it is. In general, suppose we think that sense perceptions and beliefs conflict, and that apparently we cannot resolve such conflicts. From these two claims we may conclude not that all sense perceptions and all beliefs are true (i.e. phenomenalism), but rather that although, at most, some sense perceptions and beliefs are true, apparently we cannot know which are true and which are not. So we may rather conclude that:

Skepticism argues that apparently we cannot know what the things themselves are really like; but it assumes that the things themselves really are thus and so as opposed to not thus and so, and that we can think about and make claims about how the things themselves may really be. Phenomenalism, on the other hand, argues that things are both thus and so and not thus and so; and relativism argues that it is impossible—in principle and not just for us—even to think about or make claims about how things may really be, it is only possible to think about and make claims about how things are relative to us, our appearances and our conception of things.
For example, if some wine appears sweet to one, and if one goes on on this basis to believe that the wine is sweet, then this belief is not (according to claim 7) at all about the wine itself, it is only about the wine as it appears to one and to one’s taste. 

As we might say, it may be possible for God, or in general for a being whose knowledge does not at all depend on sense perception and on appearances based on sense perception, to think and speak of the things themselves, even if this is not possible for us, or, in general, for a being whose knowledge depends on sense perception and on appearances based on sense perception. According to claim 11, there may be true and false statements about the things themselves, i.e. statements that truly or falsely state what the things themselves are like, even if we cannot entertain such statements—perhaps God alone can entertain such statements. We cannot entertain such statements because, according to claim 7, we can only think and speak about things as they appear to us and as we conceive them; we cannot think or speak of the things themselves.
So what must we add to claims 2, 3 and 7 in order to ensure that the combination of these claims entails not only that all our appearances and all our beliefs are true of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them (i.e. claim 10), but that all our appearances and all our beliefs are, simply, true (i.e. phenomenalism) ? Evidently, we must add that:

So they argue that things are radically indeterminate because things change always and in every way and nothing is constant about anything; and they conclude that it is impossible to think and speak about things (i.e. this is impossible in principle, not just for us). But, as Aristotle understands them, they defend these claims



2. Sense perceptions, and beliefs in general, conflict with each other.


3. It is apparently impossible to resolve conflicts among sense perceptions and in general among beliefs.

4. The truth is hidden from us or not evident to us.

5. Things have certain qualities as opposed to others (they are thus and so, as opposed to not thus and so), but apparently we cannot know what qualities they have. (=scepticism)

6. (1 and 2) entails either phenomenalism or scepticism

7. Our sense perceptions and beliefs are only of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them; they are not about the things themselves.

8. There is a sharp distinction between, on the one hand, things as they appear to us and in general things as we conceive them and, on the other hand, the things themselves; indeed, this distinction is so sharp that we can think and speak about appearances even if it is impossible to think and speak about the things themselves.
9. 9.All our appearances and all our beliefs are true. (=phenomenalism)
10. All our appearances and all our beliefs are true of things as they appear to us and as we conceive them.
11. It may be possible in principle to think and speak of the things themselves, even if it is not possible for us to think and speak of the things themselves (hence even if we can only think and speak about things as they appear to us and in general as we conceive them)
12. It is impossible to think or speak of the things themselves; and this is impossible in principle, not just for us.
13. The things themselves are so radically indeterminate that it is impossible to think and speak of them (i.e. this is impossible in principle, not just for us).
14. All things change always and in every way, and there is nothing constant about anything.


1. Our sense perceptions, and in general our beliefs, are only about things as they appear to us and as we conceive them; they are not about the things themselves. (=claim 7 in the previous subsection)
But it is perhaps natural to understand this claim to mean that:
2. Our sense perceptions, and in general our beliefs, are only of things that are what they are only relative to our senses, and in general to our minds; they are not about things that are what they are simply in virtue of themselves.


> [1010b30–35] But in general, if only what is sense-perceptible exists, then nothing would exist if there were no minds [empsucha, i.e. things that have senses and in general souls or minds]; for there would be no sense perception. Now, the view that neither sense- perceptible things nor sense perceptions exist may perhaps be true; for sense perception is an affection of a thing that has sense perception. But the view that the underlying things, which produce the sense perception [in a thing that has sense perception], do not exist without the sense perception - this view is impossible.
> [1010b35–1011a2] For sense perception is not simply directed at itself, rather there is also something other than [heteron] and distinct from [para] the sense perception, which is necessarily prior to the sense perception. This is because that which causes change [to kinoun] is naturally prior to that which is caused to change [to kinoumenon] - and this is so even if these are said to be correlative. (1010b30–1011a2)


first (b35–36), what we perceive with our senses are objects other than and distinct from our sense perceptions; second (b34 and b37–1011a1), the objects that we perceive are the objects that cause our sense perceptions; and third (b36–37), the objects that we perceive are essentially prior to our sense perceptions, i.e. they are independent of and causally explanatory of our sense perceptions. We may call this, 'a causal realist theory of sense perception'. It is a causal theory because it argues that the objects that we perceive are the objects that cause our sense perceptions. It is a realist theory because it argues, first, that what we perceive with our senses are objects other than and distinct from our sense perceptions and, second, that the objects that we perceive are essentially prior to our sense perceptions, i.e. they are independent of and causally explanatory of our sense perceptions.

For he argues that what appears to our senses is, precisely, the things themselves, i.e. things that are different from (hetera), distinct from (para), and prior to (protera) our perceptions of them;

More positively, however, his causal realist theory of sense perception allows him to argue that if we can think and speak about things as they appear to us, and in particular to our senses, then we can also think and speak of the things themselves.

For our sense perceptions are caused by the things themselves and, as a consequence, they are of the things themselves.


Aristotle argues that how things appear to us and especially to our senses is the product of how the things themselves act on our senses; and that it is this causal relation between the things themselves and our senses that explains how we can perceive things in the first place. So it emerges that the only or the best explanation of why things as they appear to us and to our senses are sufficiently determinate for PNC to be true of them and for us to be able to think and speak of them is, precisely, that the things themselves are determinate and that PNC is true of them.


So it emerges that, apparently, the disputants of PNC-M are in effect conceiving of the things as they appear to us, i.e. of appearances, as if they were primary beings. For they think that the things as they appear to us are determinate in virtue of themselves and not in virtue of their relation to other things—and in particular not in virtue of their relation to what they themselves, the disputants, conceive as the things themselves. But to be something determinate in virtue of itself is, precisely, a good candidate answer to the question: ‘What is it for something to be a primary being?’
Clearly, this begins to look like a formidable challenge to the disputants of PNC-M. For suppose, on the one hand, that the disputants simply accept that it is the appearances that are the primary beings. Then it will be difficult for them at all to distinguish appearances from the things themselves. We may recall that they want to distinguish appearances from the things themselves, since their whole point against PNC-M is that PNC may be true only of appearances and not of the things themselves.



For it is in virtue of having an essence that a thing, x, is a determinate thing in the first place; i.e. it is in virtue of having an essence that a thing is the very thing that it is, as opposed to any other thing.

n particular, we can think and speak about a thing, x, only if there is some property, F, such that x is F and x cannot at once be not-F. 

For, on this proto-conception of essence, a particular is the very particular that it is, as opposed to any other particular, precisely in virtue of having an essence


Section 1: Essence and attribute
Section 2: Radical changing, so no essence
Section 3: Since radical changing, we cannot think and speak about things themselves. 
Section 4: We can think and speak, so we must be thinking and speaking not about reality, but about our appearances of reality.
