<h3 id="introduction-to-the-dialog">Introduction to the dialog</h3>

<p>Socrates and his interlocutors are interested in the nature of knowledge. What is it? They agree that whatever knowledge is, it must have these following two marks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Knowledge must always be of what is</li>
  <li>knowledge must always be unerring (152c).</li>
</ol>

<p>They consider three suggestions, the first of which is the claim that <strong>knowledge is perception</strong> (KP)(151e). If knowledge is perception, then perception must always be of what is, and perception must always be unerring. What ensues is first an argument that perception does satisfy these requirements and then Socrates’ rebuttal.  Our interest is in the metaphysical underpinnings for this argument and Socrates’ rebuttal of them. These two claims are as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Protagoras’ Measure Doctrine:</dt>
  <dd>“man is the measure of all things: of the things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not.” (MM)(152a)</dd>
</dl>

<p>(Note that ‘man’ translates the Greek word ‘anthropos’. This word is neutral with respect to gender. Newer translations use ‘human’, but that raises issues for how to translate single neuter personal pronouns from Greek into English, e.g., a human is a measure by him/her/them? being such and such. So, just remember that the doctrines presented in Greek are gender neutral.)</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Heraclitus’ flux doctrine:</dt>
  <dd>all things that ‘are’, “are in the process of coming to be”(AF) (152e).</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="the-measure-doctrine">The Measure Doctrine</h2>

<p>Protagoras claims that man is the measure of the things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not. But what does this mean? Distinguish these two claims</p>

<ol>
  <li>Man is the measure of the things which exist, that they exist, and of things which do not exist, that they do not eixst.</li>
  <li>Man is the measure of the things which are F, that they are F, and of things which are not F, that they are not F.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider Helen of Troy. The first claim says that Helen exists only because of her relationship to some person. The second claims says that some property Helen has is a property she has only in relationship to some person. It is clear that Protagoras means the second claims. For instance, Socrates tells us that when the wind blows one of us may feel cold and the other not cold. He asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in that case are we going to say that the wind itself, by itself, is cold or not cold? Or shall we listen to Protagoras, and say it is cold for the one who feels cold, and for the other, not cold? (152b).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Protagoras is contrasted to someone who believes that the wind is say, cold, in virtue itself. He responds that the wind ‘by itself’ does not have this property. Rather, it is cold in virtue of someone experiencing it that way.</p>

<p>Further evidence is found at 157a where we are told that Protagoras does not believe that anything is itself <em>hot</em> or
<em>anything else</em>. Again, Socrates states MM as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nothing in itself is just one thing: nothing which you could rightly call anything or any kind of thing.(152d)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An entity X is not in virtue of itself one thing, which is clarified as the claim that X is not in virtue of itself any one kind of thing.</p>

<p>MM, then, is never presented as <em>simply</em> the thesis that man is the measure that an object exists. Rather, it is primarily presented as the thesis that an object is determinate only in virtue of the relationship it has to something else, i.e.,  a man.</p>

<p>MM seems reasonable when we focus on properties like being cold and hot, sweet and sour, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We may also suggest that the theory would stand firm most successfully in the position which we sketched out for it in our attempt to bring help to Protagoras. I mean the position that most things are for the individual what they seem to him to be; for instance, warm, dry, sweet and all this type of thing. (Tht. 171d9–e3)10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He even suggests that Protagoras’ claim may be irrefutable when restricted to immediate perception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But so long as we keep within the limits of that immediate present experience of the individual which gives rise to perceptions and to perceptual judgements, it is more difficult to convict these latter of being untrue—but perhaps I’m talking nonsense. Perhaps it is not possible to convict them at all; perhaps those who profess that they are perfectly evident and are always knowledge may be saying what really is. (Tht. 179c2–7)11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably, ice is cold only because we experience it as cold. Another creature might experience it as hot, so it is hot for that creature. The properties ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ are not properties of the ice that it has in virtue of itself. It has these properties, if at all, only in virtue of someone or something experiencing it as hot or cold. It can even have both properties at the same time: it might be hot to you and cold to me. It has both properties, but it has them in relationship to different things or people.</p>

<p>But, MM is not the innocent thesis that objects have <strong>some</strong> features only because they are experienced in certain ways. Distinguish what Gail Fine (1996, 213–214) Narrow from Broad Protagoreanism as follows:  Narrow MM is restricted to the “immediate present experience of the individual.”(179c) That is, it is restricted to our beliefs about what we sense with our five sense. In contrast, Broad MM is not restricted. It applies to all beliefs, both perceptible and non-perceptible. Protagoras accepts the Broad view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As each thing appears to me, so it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it is for you-you and I each being a man (152a).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Protagoras uses ‘appear’ here. There are many things that we are aware of that we do not perceive. An argument can appear valid, a situation can appear dangerous, etc. Restricted to the senses we would not normally use the word ‘perceive’ to cover these cases. I do not smell the argument as valid. So, the claim that knowledge is perception should be taken somewhat loosely: Protagoras has not restricted the thesis to just that which is perceived through the senses. He means that if X appears F to me, then X <strong>is</strong> F, where the appearance can be through the senses, or some other means.</p>

<p>How does MM (along with AF) show that knowledge is perception? Recall our two conditions for knowledge. The first said that knowledge must always be of what is. This means that knowledge is of, or directed towards, an entity haveing some property or other, e.g., I know that Socrates is ugly, I know that ice is cold, I know that the square is a figure. Of course, we can also know that an object exists, but that knowledge will consist in, and be dependent upon, knowing in what way it is determinate, i.e. there is no possibility of knowing that an entity exists without knowing that it is some other way or other.</p>

<p>If MM is true, then perception obviously satisfies condition 1 for knowledge. If X appears F to me, then X is F. So, in proposing perception as a candidate for knowledge, they are suggesting that, and going on to inquire whether, we can perceive the determination of an object.</p>

<p>Our second condition for knowledge states that knowledge must be unerring. It is unerring in the sense that possession of this power/capacity ensures that one can perform a function flawlessly. If I have ‘knowledge’, I always judge correctly the condition of whatever I know. Thus, in proposing perception as a candidate for knowledge, they are suggesting that this capacity is always unerring. If we perceive that objects have a certain determination, we cannot be wrong. That is, perception never goes wrong.</p>

<p>Let’s pause to consider how radical MM is. If MM is true, there are no non-subjective facts about reality. The nature of reality would, in effect, be determined by how it appears to us. If this is true, there can be no genuine disagreement about the nature of reality nor anyone with special authority over any aspect of reality. Since, for Protagoras, all men judge truly (170c) MM makes all men equal in expertise (169d).</p>

<p>Consider a few odd implications suggested in the text:</p>

<ol>
  <li>After Theodorus introduces Theaetetus to Socrates by pointing to their physical similarities, Socrates questions whether Theodorus has the expertise to evaluate their physical resemblance (145a). If MM is true, there are no experts, say artists, about physical resemblances.</li>
  <li>Theaetetus finds it obvious that if he and Socrates were both lyres and Theodorus claimed that they were both similarly tuned, that they should not take his word straightaway. Rather, they must first find out “if he were speaking with any expert knowledge of music.”(144e) They should only trust the judgment of an expert. If MM is true, the musician is not better at judging the tuning of an instrument than a non-expert.</li>
  <li>According to Protagoras, there is no reason to favour the doctor’s judgment over his patient’s as to whether the patient will take a fever tomorrow. If MM is true, the doctor’s and the patient’s judgment about their prognosis are equivalent (178c).</li>
  <li>If MM is true, then the grower’s judgment is no more reliable than the musician as to whether a future wine will be dry or sweet.</li>
  <li>If MM is true, there are no mishearings and other misperceivings (157e). In a false perception, it may appear to a perceiver than x is F, but in fact x is not-F. If MM is true, such a phenomenon does not occur. Socrates explains: 
  &gt; “in these conditions we surely have false perceptions. Here it is far from being true that all things which appear to the individual also are. On the contrary, no one of the things which appear to him really is.”(158a).</li>
</ol>

<p>Theodorus sums up the consequences of MM as follows: “the chief point on which the theory [MM] is convicted of error”(179b) is that it has the consequence that no man is superior in knowledge to any other.</p>

<p><strong>MM has the consequence that of each man he is “in reality no better authority than a tadpole.”(161d)</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-defense-of-mm-the-secret-doctrine">The Defense of MM: The Secret Doctrine</h2>

<p>MM is radical. So, why would anyone accept it? Here is how Socrates introduces Protagoras’ defense:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Well, it is not likely that a wise man would talk nonsense. So let us follow him up. Now doesn’t it sometimes happen that when the same wind is blowing, one of us feels cold and the other not? Or that one feels rather cold and the other very cold?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>THT.: That certainly does happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Well then, in that case are we going to say that the wind itself, by itself, is cold or not cold? Or shall we listen to Protagoras, and say it is cold for the one who feels cold, and for the other, not cold?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>THT.: It looks as if we must say that. (152b1–9)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Was Protagoras one of those omniscient people? Did he perhaps put this out as a riddle for the common crowd of us, while he revealed <strong>the Truth as a secret doctrine to his own pupils?</strong>…I’ll tell you; and this, now, is certainly no ordinary theory. (152c8–d2)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: This, now, is certainly no ordinary theory—I mean the theory that there is nothing which in itself is just one thing: nothing which you could rightly call anything or any kind of thing. If you call a thing large, it will reveal itself as small, and if you call it heavy, it is liable to appear light, and so on with everything, <strong>because nothing is anything or any kind of thing. Rather, the things of which we naturally say that they ‘are’, are in process of coming to be, as the result of movement and change and blending with one another. We are wrong when we say they ‘are’, since nothing ever is, but everything is coming to be. (152d2–e1)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A secret doctrine! Socrates here attributes to Protagoras a radical theory of flux, a theory that was most famously defended by Heraclitus. You might have heard of him if you ever heard someone say that you cannot step in the same river twice. Heraclitus supposedly used that claim to illustrate his overall metaphysical picture: everything is in a constant state of change. That everything is constantly changing may seem an innocent claim. Consider your age. By convention, we may say that you are 21 years of age. But, really, you are 21 years, X number of days, and Y number of hours, and Z number of minutes of age. Your age is constantly increasing. You are never the exact same age from one moment to the next. If you were to calculate your weight down to the atomic level, your weight would also change from one moment to the next. How about being still? If you are currently sitting right now, are you truly at rest? No! Of course, you are at rest in relation to the room. But our planet is hurtling through the solar system at dramatic speeds. It is also rotating round its axis. So, we are never truly not moving.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see, there is good enough evidence for this theory that being (what passes for such) and becoming are a product of motion, while not-being and passing-away result from a state of rest. There is evidence for it in the fact that heat or fire, which presumably generates and controls everything else, is itself generated out of movement and friction-these being motions. Or am I wrong in saying these are the original sources of fire? (153a).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And isn’t it also true that bodily condition deteriorates with rest and idleness? While by exertion and motion it can be preserved for a long time?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="some-examples">Some examples</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Well now, suppose that Protagoras, or anyone else, asks you this: ‘Theaetetus, is there any way in which something can become larger or more numerous, other than by undergoing increase What will you answer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Size</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1. If X gets shorter, then X’s size must decrease</li>
  <li>P2. Socrates is taller than Theaetetus in year 1.</li>
  <li>P3. Theaetetus grows and is taller than Socrates in year 2.</li>
  <li>P4. Socrates’ size does not change from year 1 to year 2</li>
  <li>P5. Socrates changes from being taller to being shorter without his size decreasing.</li>
  <li>P6. Socrates could not change from being taller to being shorter without his size decreasing (from P1).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Number</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1. If four dice are put beside six dice, the six dice are more than the four.</li>
  <li>P2. If twelve dice are now placed beside the six dice, the six dice are less than the twelve.</li>
  <li>P3. The 6 dice have changed from being more to being less although their number has not changed.</li>
  <li>P4. Something cannot change from being more or less unless its number changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="secret-doctrine-and-perception">Secret Doctrine and Perception</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In accordance with the principle that nothing is but is always coming to be and in a constant state of motion, perceived colours must always ‘come to be’, and therefore cannot be at rest or be located anywhere, in the eyes or the object. But if one cannot locate the colour in the eye or in the object, how should one think of it (153e3)?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Whenever I come to be perceiving, I necessarily come to be perceiving something; because it’s impossible to come to be perceiving, but not perceiving anything. And whenever it comes to be sweet, bitter, or anything of that kind, it necessarily comes to be so for someone; because it’s impossible to come to be sweet, but not sweet for anyone (160a9–b3).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Well then, you must think like this. In the case of the eyes, first, you mustn’t think of what you call white colour as being some distinct thing outside your eyes, or in your eyes either—in fact you mustn’t assign any place to it; because in that case it would, surely, be at its assigned place and in a state of rest, rather than coming to be (153d8–e2).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOC.: Let’s follow what we said just now, and lay it down that nothing is one thing just by itself. On those lines, we’ll find that black, white, or any other colour will turn out to have come into being, from the collision of the eyes with the appropriate motion. What we say a given colour is will be neither the thing which collides, nor the thing it collides with, but something which has come into being between them; something peculiar to each one (153e4 –154a3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Socrates’ thesis is that neither the object nor the perceiver is coloured, or, to put it the other way, that the colour is neither in the object nor in the perceiver. Rather the colour is ‘something which has come into being between them, something peculiar to each one’.</p>

<h2 id="socrates-response">Socrates’ Response</h2>

<p>Socrates diagnoses the source of Theodorus’ chief concern with MM as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If whatever the individual judges by means of perception is true for him; if no man can access another’s experience better than he, or can claim authority to examine another man’s judgment and see if it be right or wrong; if, as we have repeatedly said, only the individual himself can judge his own world, and what he judges is always true and correct: how could it ever be my friend, that Protagoras was a wise man? (160d-e)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote brings to light the relationship Protagoras sees holding between judgment, (the forming of beliefs), and perception. We form beliefs solely based on perception for the only material available for belief formation comes from the immediate perceptual experience. For example, you could not correctly compare the Taj Mahal you see to reports someone
gives of the Taj Mahal for they are both different objects.</p>

<p>Recall that for Protagoras the way an object appears to you is the way that the object is. There is no object with a stable nature that is there to be perceived (166d). There is not even a stable perceiver waiting to perceive. What seem to be ‘my’ past experiences are someone else’s past experiences (166b-c). Rather, the perception, what is perceived, and even the perceiver are generated all in one go. We cannot even appeal to our past experiences when forming judgment about the Taj Mahal. So, it is impossible to “judge anything other than what one is immediately experiencing.” (167a-b).</p>

<p>So, Protagoras is unable to maintain a clear distinction between perception and judgment. As soon as I perceive that an object is someway, I should immediately have the belief that the object is that way. I cannot bring in material from anything outside of my immediate experiences to form a judgment.</p>

<p>Is is here that the claim that Socrates attacks the claim that knowlege is perception. He points to some features of perception and some features of belief that make it impossible that perception by itself could yield beliefs. He will argue that belief formation is an active affair that requires us to appeal to material outside of our immediate experiences. Thus, we cannot rely just on our immediate experiences to form beliefs.</p>

<p>We recall that knowledge is of an entity being determinate. Socrates claims that we cannot grasp through perception the determination of an object; that it is some F.  The argument to show this proceeds by first distinguishing between perceiving <em>through</em> and perceiving <em>with</em> our eyes and ears (184c). If we do not make this distinction, Socrates thinks we will have difficulty in showing how perceptions converge. Rather, his own view is that “we perceive with the soul through the senses” (184d). If I perceive that Helen is beautiful, I perceive this <em>with</em> my soul <em>through</em> my eyes.</p>

<p>The next step in the argument requires the premise that the objects of perception are peculiar to their senses. What I perceive through sight, I cannot perceive through hearing (185a). We attribute to both sight and sound many
things. We think they both ‘are’ and are different from one another and
the same as themselves (185a-b). However, given that the objects of
perception are peculiar to their powers, Socrates points out that we
cannot perceive these common attributes through any one sense. We cannot
perceive the ‘being’ that we attribute to each.</p>

<p>In claiming that both colour and sound ‘are’, we should not necessarily
take the ‘are’ as primarily existential. For there are at least two
other ways of reading the ‘are’. A) Yellow ‘is’ in virtue of something
being yellow. B) Yellow ‘is’ in virtue of it being bright or some such.
The prime reason for not reading ‘to be’ here as existential is that
doing so makes it difficult to understand Socrates’ claims that we
cannot perceive the ‘being’ that is common to both. If the ‘is’ was
purely existential, we might wonder why we cannot perceive that sound
exists or yellow exists. What substantial difference would there be
between perceiving a colour and perceiving that the colour exists?</p>

<p>However, by construing the main use of ‘to be’ as something other than
purely existential we can mark the distinction. There is a difference if
awareness that a colour ‘is’ is to be aware that it has some
determination; either that something is coloured or that colour has some
attributes. This is shown from Socrates’ discussion of how we perceive
hardness and softness through touch. While we perceive them through
touch, “as regards their being – they fact that they are – their
opposition to one another, and the being, again of this opposition, the
matter is different”(186b). We perceive hardness and softness. However,
in order to have beliefs about hardness and softness, we need material from elsewhere. In other words, in
order to have the belief that an entity has a determination we need to
deploy concepts like ‘is similar’ or ‘is one’, concepts that one cannot
acquire in perceiving hardness and softness. Michael Frede explains the point as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I take it that Plato wants to argue that even the question whether <em>A</em> is red is not settled by perception. We may be passively affected by the colour red, but to form the belief that something is red presupposes and takes a great deal of activity on the part of the mind. Hence, we perceive the colour red, but we do not, strictly speaking, perceive that <em>A</em> is red. Hence, knowledge, since it always involves belief, never is just a matter of perception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perception does not by itself give rise to belief. It can serve a role
in belief formation but never an exhaustive one. There is no possibility
of having beliefs that just draw upon the material provided by our
immediate experiences. This we saw was a crucial if MM was to hold.</p>
