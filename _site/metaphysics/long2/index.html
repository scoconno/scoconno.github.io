  <h1 class="page-title">Long Essay 1</h1>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You have written several short essays so far. For this assignment, you will pick one of the questions below and write a longer, standard research paper for it. The paper must be appropriately structured, have a clear thesis statement, include citations and a bibliography, and generally conform to the standard norms of an intermediate college level course.</p>

<p>You will be assessed on how you use the reading that was assigned for the topic (as well as any other <em>academic</em> sources you would like to use). Reddit, wikipedia, quora, blogs, etc., are obviously not academic sources and you will be penalized if you use them–I use software to check papers for such use.</p>

<p>You should devote significant time to researching your topic. Start early. Ask the librarians for help to identify material. Discuss drafts and ideas for your paper with me—see my website for office hours.</p>

<p><strong>Important details:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Word count: 1000–1250 words. Note that your word count does not include the bibliography, headers, or citations. It includes only the body of your paper.</li>
  <li>Due date: 11/13/2017 at noon through Blackboard.</li>
  <li>Point: 20 points towards your final grade.</li>
  <li>Citation style: use MLA, Chicago, or APA. It’s up to you, but be consistent throughout.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> ## Introduction</p>

<p>Why does the existence of higher spatial dimensions pose a threat to Internalism with respect to incongruent counterparts?</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Assume that higher spatial dimensions exist. Your essay should do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain the notion of ‘incongruent counterparts.’ Use something other than hands as an example.</li>
  <li>Explain Internalism with respect to Incongruent Counterparts.</li>
  <li>Explain the notion of a higher spatial dimension, e.g., explain the notion of a fourth spatial dimension.</li>
  <li>Explain how the existence of higher spatial dimensions poses a threat to Internalism.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. You will need to explain the terminology you introduce. Try also to find ways of explaining what a fourth dimension might be.</li>
  <li>This essay has 2 major learning goals:
    <ol>
      <li>Teach you the difference between explaining a view and arguing for a view. So, in the first part of your paper, you should neutrally explain Internalism as clearly as you can while avoiding arguing for or against it.</li>
      <li>Teach you to explain and argue for views that you might not accept.  In the first part of your essay, you should explain Internalism as clearly and charitably as you can (as if it was the view you accepted). In the second part, you will use the possibility of higher dimensions to argue against Internalism as forcibly as you can (regardless of whether you think there are higher dimensions or if you think that Internalism is true or not.)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Protagoras claims that man is the measure of all things, of the things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not. How does Aristotle understand Protagoras’ claim and how does he think that Protagoras’ argues for it? What is Aristotle’s response? Does it succeed? Give reasons for your answer.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> As charitably and forcefully as you can, present a reconstruction of Zeno’s arrow paradox. How does the at-at theory of motion purport to solve this paradox? Is that solution successful? Give reasons for your answer.</p>
