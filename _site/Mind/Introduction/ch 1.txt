+ We divide the world into those that live and those don't. We divide those that live into those that have a mind and those that don't. 
+ There are creatures that are conscious and can experience things like pain and pleasure. 
+ Consider the controversies over animals, whether they should be eaten and whether they should be tested upon. 
+ Cats and dogs experience sensation, perceive their surroundings, remember things, learn from their experiences, seem to have emotions. What about more complex emotions? 
+ What about when we move down the animal chain to oysters and insects? They seem to perceive their environment, but do they have a mind? 
+ What about machines? 
+ We can only answer these questions if know what it is to have a mind. 


## What is philosophy of mind? 

+ How does the philosophical study of mind differ from the ones we find in psychology, or cognitive science, or neuroscience. 
+ Before we can answer whether x has a mind or a thought, we need to identify the marks of mentality and thought. Before we can know, for instance, whether a scientist has offered a full and exhaustive account of consciousness, we need to clarify their target. 
+ Mind-body problem: they are so different from one another, but they are intimately connected. Change one and you change the other. There are atoms and molecules that make up cells and tissues. But these seem very different from the feeling of pleasure, the contemplation of a great work of art. 
+ Conscious experiences relate to our biological nature, but how? When c-fibre fire, we feel pain? What is the relationship between the sensation and the physical? How can the physical give rise to the mental? Relatedly, could sufficiently complex systems made from inorganic matter, i.e., machines, give rise to the mental? Our beliefs cause us to do things, but how could beliefs cause our neurons to fire and so cause our bodies to move? Biologist will tell us how the neurons firing will cause the muscles to contract, but how do beliefs and desires cause the neurons to fire in the first place. Could beliefs do this because they are themselves physical? Philosophy will tell us whether causality require beliefs and desires to be physical. 

## Varieties of mental phenomenon

“sensations or sensory qualities: pains, itches, tickles, having an afterimage, seeing a round green patch, smelling ammonia, feeling nauseous, and so on. These mental states are said to have a “phenomenal” or “qualitative” character—the way they feel or the way they look or appear. To use a popular term, there is something it is like to experience such phenomena or be in such states. Thus, pains have a special qualitative feel that is distinctive of pains—they hurt. Similarly, itches itch and tickles tickle. When you look at a green patch, there is a distinctive way the patch looks to you: It looks green, and your visual experience involves this green look. Each such sensation has its own distinctive feel and is characterized by a sensory quality that we seem to be able to identify directly, at least as to the general type to which it belongs (for example, pain, itch, or seeing green). These items are called “phenomenal” or “qualitative states,” or sometimes “raw feels.” However, “qualia” has now become the standard term for these sensory, qualitative states, or the sensory qualities experienced in such states. Collectively, these mental phenomena are said to constitute “phenomenal consciousness.”

+  “Second, there are mental states that are attributed to a person by the use of embedded that-clauses: for example, President Barack Obama hopes that Congress will pass a health-care bill this year; Senator Harry Reid is certain that this will happen, and Newt Gingrich doubts that Obama will get what he wants. Such states are called “propositional attitudes.” The idea is that these states consist in a subject’s having an “attitude” (for example, hoping, being certain, doubting, and believing) toward a “proposition” (for example, that Congress will pass a health-care bill, that it will rain tomorrow). The propositions are said to constitute the “content” of the propositional attitudes, and that-clauses that specify these propositions are called “content sentences.” Thus, the content of Obama’s hope is the proposition that Congress will pass a health-care bill this year, which is also the content of Gingrich’s doubt, and this content is expressed by the sentence “Congress will pass a health-care bill this year.” These states are also called “intentional”8 or “content-bearing” states.”

+ “And then there are various mental states that come under the broad heading of feelings and emotions. They include anger, joy, sadness, depression, elation, pride, embarrassment, remorse, regret, shame, and many others. Notice that emotions are often attributed to persons with a that-clause. In other words, some states of emotions involve propositional attitudes: For example, you could be embarrassed that you had forgotten to call your mother on her birthday, and she could be disappointed that you did. Further, some emotions involve belief: If you are embarrassed that you had forgotten your mother’s birthday, you must believe that you did. As the word feeling suggests, there is often a special qualitative component we associate with many emotions, such as anger and grief, although it is not certain that all instances of emotion are accompanied by such qualitative feels, or that there is a single specific sensory feel to each kind of emotion.”
+ “There are also what some philosophers call “volitions,” like intending, deciding, and willing. These states are propositional attitudes; intentions and decisions have content.”

## Marks of the Mental 

+ We have direct or immediate knowledge of the mental
+ Privacy or first person privilege: only you can directly know your mental states. 
+ knowledge of our own mental states is infallible. 
+ “This feature of the mental—namely, that mental states are about, or are directed upon, objects that may or may not exist or have contents that may or may not be true—has been called “intentionality.” “Broadly speaking, intentionality refers to the mind-world relation—specifically, the fact that our thoughts relate to, or hook up with, the things in the world, and represent how things are in the world. The idea at bottom is the thought that mentality is the capacity for representing the world around us, and that this is one of its essential functions. In short, the mind is a repository of inner representations—an inner mirror—of the outer world. ”

“first, conscious states, in particular sensory or qualitative states (those with “qualia”), like pains and sensings of colors and textures, and, second, intentional states, states with representational contents, like beliefs, desires, and intentions. The former seem to be paradigm cases of states that satisfy the epistemic criteria of the mental, such as direct access and privacy, and the latter are the prime examples of mental states that satisfy the intentionality criterion. An important question that is still open is this: In virtue of what common property are both sensory states and intentional states “mental”? ”
