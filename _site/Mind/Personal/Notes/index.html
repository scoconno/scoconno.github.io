<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Allow the following names for our various characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Riker” is the person who beams onto the planet 8 years ago.</li>
  <li>“William” is the person who materialized on Potemkin after Riker was de-materialized on the planet.</li>
  <li>“Thomas” is the person who materialized on the planet after Riker was de-materialized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Who is Riker? William is. Thomas is.  Both are. Neither are.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-question">Understanding the Question</h2>

<p>English can mislead us when trying to answer these questions. The words <code>identity', </code>identical’, `similar’, and ‘same’ are ambiguous; they can be used to describe different relations. And whenever a word can be used in several ways, we need to disambiguate those uses to answer questions that contain them. If a person told you they left their car near the bank, they could mean they left it near the money bank or the river bank. It’s obviously important to identify which one they mean.</p>

<p>`Same’ (and our other words) can also be used in different ways. On the one hand, it can be used to speak about qualitative similarity. Qualitative similarity is something that numerically distinct objects enjoy by sharing similar features. Two chairs are qualitatively similar in virtue of having similar shapes, sizes, and function. But they are still two chairs; if you buy both, you will have to pay twice the cost of one.</p>

<p>We can also use these words to talk about what is called numerical identity, the relation that each thing holds to itself and nothing else. Clark Kent and Superman are numerically identical. `Numerical identity’ is used when we want to say that there is just one entity to be counted. Suppose you know that Superman and Clark Kent were in the room. You would make a mistake if you counted them as two people; there is just one person there.</p>

<p>Humans obviously change their qualities over time. You and the baby you grew from share few, if any, features. You may have the same color eyes, but you are different sizes, different weight, made of different cells, different hair lengths, different tastes and dispositions. Nevertheless, you and that baby are numerically identical.</p>

<p>It is important that you and that baby are numerically identical. Numerical identity undergirds many of our moral and social institutions. The social security number assigned to that baby belongs to whoever is numerically identical to her. Being only qualitatively similar does not suffice. That would mean a twin could get that baby’s social security. The prison sentence delivered to a defendant should only be served by prisoners identical to that defendant. Suppose a prisoner is in the 10th year of a prison sentence for a crime committed by a person that they are only qualitatively similar to. What an injustice that would be! They would be serving a sentence for a crime that they did not commit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless that prisoner might be very different from the defendant. They may have had a religious conversion, changed their body shape, etc. Question of personal identity are this:</p>

<p>‘Is Riker the same as Thomas and/or William?’ could mean either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is the identity of Riker the same as the identity of Thomas and/or
William?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is Riker qualitatively similar to Thomas and/or William?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is Riker numerically identical to Thomas and/or William?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is a relation that is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a relation that everything bears to itself and nothing else.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A relation R is reflexive iff everything bears R to itself.</p>

        <p>Example: everything is <em>the same height</em> as itself. ‘The same
height’ is a reflexive relation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A relation R is symmetric iff, if x is related by R to y, then y
is related by R to x.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Example: if Susan is <em>a sibling of</em> Sarah, then Sarah is <em>a
sibling of</em> Susan. ‘Being a sibling of’ is a symmetrical
relation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A relation R is transitive iff, if x is related by R to y, and y
is related by R to z, then x is related by R to z.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Example: if Susan is <em>shorter than</em> Sarah, and Sarah is
<em>shorter than</em> Hannah, then Susan is <em>shorter than</em> Hannah.
‘Short than’ is a transitive relation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

<h1 id="survival--immortality">Survival &amp; Immortality</h1>

<p>There are three participants in this dialogue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Gretchen Weirob, a philosophy professor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sam Miller, a chaplain and longtime friend of Gretchen’s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dave Cohen, a former student of Gretchen’s</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Challenge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Gretchen, who is dying in the hospital, challenges Sam, a chaplain
and religious believer, to prove to her that survival after the
death of the body is possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Sam can do that, Gretchen says that she will be comforted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sam and Dave consider various arguments for thinking that persons
can survive the death of the body, but Gretchen remains unconvinced.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="clarifying-the-challenge">Clarifying the Challenge</h1>

<p>Is survival <em>possible</em>, could mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is survival likely?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is survival compatible with the laws of physics?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is survival metaphysically possible?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Can we conceive of a coherent possible situation in which
survival without the body occurred?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An analogy: Are square circles metaphysically possible?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A square is a figure with four equal straight sides and four right
angles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A circle is a plane figure whose boundary (the circumference)
consists of points equidistant from a fixed point (the center).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To coherently conceive of a square circle requires us to conceive of
a figure with four equal straight sides and whose boundary consists
of points equidistant from a fixed point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married bachelors are metaphysically impossible: Given what it is to
be a bachelor, it is impossible to conceive of a bachelor who is
married.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is metaphysically possible that life on Earth did not come into
being: Given what we know about the conditions required for life, we
can imagine a scenario in which life never came about on Earth,
e.g., a scenario in which there was no oxygen on Earth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is metaphysically possible that you did not come into being:
there are scenarios in which the conditions required for your
conception and birth were not satisfied.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="survival">Survival</h1>

<h2 id="two-considerations">Two Considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>G survives iff there is a person P at a time after her body has died
such that G is identical to P.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Survival must offer comfort of anticipation, e.g., it must make
sense for G to look forward to P’s pleasures and to fear P’s pains.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Conceiving Survival</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Persons must be such that we can <em>coherently</em> conceive a possible
situation in which some person P exists yet 1) P does not have G’s
body, and 2) G = P</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are we conceiving persons to be in such a situation?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember! Qualitative similarity <em>vs.</em> numerical identity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two ginger bread men made by the same cookie cutter are
qualitatively similar in several respects, e.g., they have the same
shape, the same weight, the same colour, smell, and so on. But these
are <em>two</em> numerically distinct entities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superman and Clark Kent are numerically identical, i.e., they are
one and the same entity. If you want to count the number of entities
in the room, you should only count Superman and Clark Kent once:
Louis Lane makes a mistake when she counts them as two.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

You may lose a lot! But suppose that you play her 100 times and win 1
game. This establishes that while it’s improbable that you’ll beat her
on some occasion, it’s still possible. This small possibility is enough
to give you hope. Similarly, Gretchen will be comforted if surviving her
bodily death, even if highly improbable, is still possible.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-personal-identity-consist-in">What does personal identity consist in?</h1>

<p>Despite their qualitative differences, what is it about G that makes her
the very same person as P?</p>

<p>Three Options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Same Body</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Same Soul</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Psychological Continuity</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="sameness-of-body">Sameness of Body</h1>

<p><img src="body.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time iff
the body of A is identical to the body of B.</p>

<p><img src="rikerb.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Does this meet Gretchen’s challenge?</p>

<p>No! G’s challenge is met only if there exists a person some time after
her body has died who has her body. But the challenge assumes that her
body has died.</p>

<p>Virtues of this view?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can perceive bodies. Thus, the view explains how we are able to
keep track and re-identify humans over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Problems for this view?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Body swaps!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="sameness-of-soul">Sameness of Soul</h1>

<p><img src="soul.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Sameness of Soul</p>

<p>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time iff
the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.</p>

<p><img src="rikersoul.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>What is the soul?</p>

<p>Immaterial</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bodies are extended in 3-dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Souls have no extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are simple bodies—the basic bits of matter—and complex bodies
composed of matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Souls are neither simple or complex bodies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Seat of consciousness</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For any thought and experience, there must be some entity which does
the thinking and experiencing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Souls and not bodies are what think and experience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time
iff the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is there for this claim?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could we know that the soul of A is identical to the soul of B?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Direct experience?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Indirect experience: Same Body</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Indirect experience: Same Psychology</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Indirect Experience 1 Claim</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Same body entails same soul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We directly perceive bodies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We indirectly perceive souls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If we can know that B is true, then B can be known either <em>a
posteriori</em> or <em>a priori</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B cannot be known <em>a posteriori</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B cannot be known <em>a priori</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we cannot know that B is true.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Discussion of P2 <img src="apost.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With the chocolate, I can test. My test involves me perceiving both the
chocolate and the inside. We keep checking and we come to know that
certain wrapper is associated with certain filling. But we can’t check
whether souls are associated with bodies.</p>

<p>Discussion of P3</p>

<p><img src="apr.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Indirect Experience 2 Claim</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Same psychology entail same soul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can directly know that the psychology of A is the same as the
psychology of B.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we can indirectly know that the soul of A is the same as the
soul of B.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If same psychology entailed same soul, then exemplification of
psychological traits would be infallible evidence for sameness of
soul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exemplification of psychological traits are not infallible evidence
for sameness of soul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Same psychology does not entail same soul.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Fallible vs. Infallible Evidence for Personal Identity</p>

<p><img src="twins.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Swapping Souls Consider a scenario in which 1) a series of souls flow
into and out of the same body, and 2) that same body exhibits the same
psychological traits. If personal identity consists in sameness of soul,
then there is a numerically distinct person every time a soul is
exchanged. However, with every soul exchange there is no corresponding
change in psychological traits. Thus, same psychology does not entail
same soul.</p>
