  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Physicalism is the belief that mental events and their properties are entirely physical and can be described in the same objective physical way as all other phenomena in the world. If physicalism is true, then a complete physical description of every mental state must contain all the information there is to know about those states. In ‘The Knowledge Argument’, Frank Jackson uses his famous Mary thought-experiment to show that this is not the case: that there are facts about mental states not entailed by a complete physical description. Several objections have been raised against Jackson’s argument, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mary gains ability knowledge, not new propositional knowledge</li>
  <li>Mary learns nothing new when leaving the room.</li>
  <li>Mary comes to know the same physical fact but in a different way.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explain and assess one of these objections to Jackson’s Knowledge Argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This assignment involves three distinct tasks, each with its own sub-task.</p>

<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Formulate Jackson’s Knowledge Argument. To do this, you must do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the premises of the Knowledge Argument.</li>
  <li>Explain each premise carefully in your words. Use your own examples.</li>
  <li>Explain why the conclusion of the argument shows physicalism to be false.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Explain <strong>one</strong> of the objections to Jackson’s Knowledge Argument—your choice!** To do this, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the entry on the Knowledge Argument in the Stanford Encyclopedia <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge">here</a> or a different encyclopedia entry <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/know-arg/">here</a>. You can also read the relevant entry in the textbook.</li>
  <li>Pick <strong>one</strong> of the objections discussed there and explain it.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Criticize the objection.** To do this, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the weakest claim made by the objection.</li>
  <li>Explain why that claim is weak in your own words. Use your own examples.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>

<p>This is a standard college level paper. It should be structured accordingly and must include a propery bibliography and citations. You can use any citation style you like as long as you remain consistent throughout your paper.</p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>Your essay must be 500–750 words long. The bibliography, title, name, etc., do not count towards the word count. Essays shorter than 500 words will lose points. Essays longer than 750 words will lose points.  I recommend the following structure to your paper:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction: 50 words.</li>
  <li>Task 1: 200-250 words.</li>
  <li>Task 2: 200-250 words.</li>
  <li>Task 3: 100-150 words.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Please submit the file as either a word file or simple .rtf file. I can also accept pdfs.</p>
