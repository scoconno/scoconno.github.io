  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Last week we examined Frank Jackson’s powerful argument against physicalism. According to Jackson, many facts about consciousness are not physical facts. If the argument succeeds, then consciousness cannot be explained by the natural sciences; it is not something that simply arises from the brain. Jackson’s argument relied on the simple intuition that we cannot learn what it’s like to have a red experience by learning everything that happens in the brain when a person sees red. This shows that some facts about consciousness, for instance facts about what it’s like to see red, are not explained by facts about the brain.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, many have reacted strongly to Jackson’s Knowledge Argument. Various philosophers, neuroscientists, and cognitive scientists are convinced that something is wrong with Jackson’s argument; they do not fully understand how the brain could give rise to consciousness but they are convinced that it does, and many of them invest their research energy into explaining how it does. The various responses to Jackson can be characterized by thinking about the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When Mary comes out of the room and first sees something red, does she acquire new knowledge?</li>
  <li>If she does acquire new knowledge, is what she comes to know some new fact about our experience of which she was previously ignorant?</li>
</ol>

<p>I will discuss three responses to Jackson below. The first, and most straightforward, denies that Mary acquires new knowledge when she leaves the room. If Mary acquires no new knowledge when she leaves the room, then we have no reason yet to think that facts about consciousness are not explained by facts about our brain. The second and third accept that Mary learns something new, but they deny that this new knowledge is knowledge of any facts about the experience of red. The second claims that Mary only learns a new ability and that learning a new ability is different from learning new facts. The third claims she learns a new way to present a fact that she had already knowledge about and this is different from learning a new fact. Here is a table to remind you of the various views we will discuss. The first line represents Jackson’s position: Mary acquires new knowledge of what she was previously ignorant about.</p>

<h2 id="response-1-mary-can-imagine-red-before-her-release">Response 1: Mary can imagine red before her release</h2>

<p>After Mary learns all the physical facts about our experience of red, Jackson claims that she still does not know what it is like to experience red. Our first objection denies this. It claims that Mary can imagine red by learning all the physical facts about experiencing red. The idea is that we can learn what it is like to experience red in different ways. We could see, say, a red tomato. Or we could imagine a red tomato. Our first objection claims that Mary could imagine red without ever seeing something red. If this is true, she knows what is it like to experience red before leaving room. Thus, she would learn nothing new by seeing red for the very first time.</p>

<p>How should we assess this response? On the one hand, we can imagine things that we have not seen in person by studying information about that thing. Suppose an architect is provided the plans for a building that was constructed in, say, Alexandria, Egypt. Suppose also that this architect has never personally seen the building. A good architect can imagine what the building looks like just by studying the plans. The knowledge they gain from the plans allows them to imagine what the building looks like and so come to know what the building looks like, even though they have never seen the building. Generally, we should accept that we can imagine some things that we have never seen before.</p>

<p>Is red one of these things we can imagine if we have never seen it? Might we imagine red just by studying what happens in a person’s brain when they see red? While this seems similar to the architect imagining a building from some plans, there are some important differences in the cases. An architect has seen buildings before. They know what buildings look like even if they have not seen some specific building. Mary, on the other hand, has not only never seen red. She has never seen any color. It would be one thing if she had seen brown, pink, and orange, and we asked her to imagine a combination of these. But she has seen no color whatsoever.</p>

<p>It does seem unlikely that someone without any color experience could imagine red. If it were true that they could imagine red by learning all the physical facts about the experience of red, then that knowledge would guarantee the capacity to imagine red. In other words, it would be impossible to have complete physical knowledge of the experience of red and not have the ability to imagine red. Similarly, it would be impossible to have complete knowledge of the building’s design without being able to imagine what it looks like. But this seems false when it comes to our experience of red. A completely blind scientist who studies color vision by reading the results from her machines in braille does not have the ability to imagine red. So, if our blind scientist is unable to imagine red by knowing all the physical facts, why should Mary have the ability to imagine red by just knowing all the physical facts about the experience of red?</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that this objection to the Knowledge Argument fails. It is difficult to understand how anyone can know what it is like to see red without actually ever having seen something red.</p>

<h2 id="response-2-mary-gains-ability-knowledge">Response 2: Mary gains ability knowledge</h2>

<p>The Knowledge Argument assumes that Mary learns some new fact after she leaves the room, i.e., she learns some fact about the experience of red. But some have claimed that the new knowledge Mary gains is a different kind of knowledge altogether. The view is motivated by distinguishing between learning a fact and learning how to do something, between <em>factual knowledge</em> and <em>ability knowledge</em>. Physicalism is not undermined if Mary only acquires ability knowledge upon leaving the room. David Lewis writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Ability Hypothesis says that knowing what an experience is like just is the possession of these abilities to remember, imagine, and recognize. … It isn’t knowing-that. It’s knowing-how. (Lewis 1990, 516)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lewis concedes that “knowing what an experience is like” requires having the experience. He also agrees that knowing all the physical facts about the experience of red will not let you know what it is like to have the experience.  But Lewis denies that coming to “know what an experience is like” is a matter of learning new facts. He thinks that Jackson’s argument proves that we learn no new information at all when we have a new experience.  Rather, we learn some new abilities.</p>

<p>Consider other examples of knowing-how, or ability knowledge. I know how to ride a bicycle. I know how to sail a boat. I know how to play guitar. This knowledge seems different from the propositional knowledge I have about, say, geometry, e.g., that a line is the shortest distance between two points. Even though I know how to sail a boat, I’m unsure I can formulate this knowledge in terms of a series of propositions that I know. I just move the tiller a certain way when I need to. I trim the sail, alter course, tac and jibe when I need to. I could never articulate this knowledge, just like I could never articulate my knowledge of how to ride a bicycle into a series of facts about bicycle riding. Our ability knowledge does seem different from knowledge of any facts. Just imagine someone reading everything there was to know about riding a bike or some martial art. Would they excel at bike riding and martial arts the first time they tried even though they had never practiced? We can all agree that this is unlikely.</p>

<p>So, perhaps all Mary gains when she leaves the room is some new abilities. What are these abilities?</p>

<ol>
  <li>the ability to remember experiencing red</li>
  <li>the ability to imagine or visualize the color red</li>
  <li>the ability to recognize objects as red by sight</li>
  <li>the ability to recognize experiences of red (as experiences of that sort, which you’ve had before)</li>
</ol>

<p>This response to the Knowledge Argument has many problems. I will survey three.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>These various abilities seem neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to have an experience of red. Consider
The ability to imagine something. I have eaten truffles, so I know what truffles taste and smell like. But I find it difficult to imagine tastes and smells. Images are easy. But tastes are smells are really hard. So, even though I know what it is like to have an experience of eating a truffle, I am unable to imagine the taste. If Lewis’ reply was correct, then the fact that I know what a truffle tastes like means I should also have the ability to imagine that taste. But I don’t! So, possession of this ability is not necessary for knowing what various experiences are like.</p>

<p>In addition, it also seems possible to have the ability to imagine some property Q without knowing what it is like to experience Q. Suppose, for instance, you are very good at imagining colors, but you have yet the opportunity to imagine each color-you just haven’t got round to it yet. Many of us have abilities that we haven’t yet exercised, e.g., I’m pretty sure I can play the Irish National Anthem on the guitar, but I haven’t ever sat down and done it. So it seems that these abilities are not sufficient for knowledge of an experience–I could imagine what it is like to experience red without knowing what a red object looks like.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>

<p>A second and related problem is that there is a difference between having an ability and knowing what it is like to exercise that ability. Mike Thau puts it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leon has seen red, like the rest of us, but at the age of 20 he shuts himself up in the black and white room for 30 years. Leon retains the ability to visualize red, to remember what experiences of red are like, and so on. But we can suppose that, while he’s in the room, he never exercises these abilities. He hasn’t visualized red or had any memories of seeing red for all that time. At the age of 50, Leon comes out of the room again, and looks at a ripe tomato. He says, “I’d forgotten what it’s like to see red! Now I know again.” Mike Thau</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, I know how to trim a sail. But I haven’t done it in ages. When I sail again, I will trim the sail and say, ‘wow, I had forgotten what it is like to trim a sail.’ Lewis claims that Mary learns new abilities when she sees red. But Mary seems to also acquire knowledge of what it is like to exercise those abilities. It’s unclear whether acquiring abilities is the same as learning what it is like to exercise them, so Lewis may have confused what happens when Mary see red for the very first time. Perhaps we can describe this as her exercising an ability to recognize a red object. But this is not the same as learning how to recognize a red object. The point here is that Lewis wants to describe what happens when Mary leaves the room as her learning new abilities. But this doesn’t fully capture what is happening. You can have an ability and not exercise it. And, even if Mary acquires new abilities upon leaving the room, she also seems to be exercising them. Lewis’ account does not explain the new knowledge Mary acquires by this exercise.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h3>

<p>Lewis’ response requires that all Mary learns are abilities. If she learns any new facts, then his response fails. In other words, Jackson can agree that Mary learns new abilities. Jackson’s point is that Mary also learns some new facts. Has Lewis proved that Mary learns no new fact whatsoever?</p>

<p>Recall that Mary is investigating the experiences of others. She learns every physical fact about John’s experience of red. So, our question is whether she learns anything new about John’s experience of red when she has her own first red experience herself. Lewis’ has yet to show that Mary does not learn such facts, even though he might be right that Mary also learns some new abilities upon leaving the room.</p>

<h2 id="response-3-new-ways-of-knowing-the-same-fact">Response 3: New ways of knowing the same fact</h2>

<p>Assume that there was some knowledge that Mary lacked before leaving the room. Assume that Mary acquires new knowledge upon leaving the room. Does Mary thereby come to acquire knowledge of some new fact? Our final objection denies this. It claims that Mary has come to think about some fact she already knew in a different way. What does it mean to say that there are different ways to learn the same fact? Consider these two sentences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‘Batman saved Gotham City from the Joker’</li>
  <li>‘Bruce Wayne saved Gotham City from the Joker’</li>
</ol>

<p>These two sentences express the same fact, but they describe that fact in two different ways; there was only one event that happened, but we can describe it in two different ways. We obviously could learn this one fact in different ways. Suppose that you don’t know on Monday that Batman and Bruce Wayne are numerically identical. On Monday, you would then know the first sentence without knowing the second. Suppose you learn on Tuesday that Bruce Wayne is Batman. You would then know that sentence 2 is true. But you haven’t learned some new fact by learning that 2 is true. You have learned the same fact in some new way. Similarly, our third objection claims that Mary doesn’t learn any new facts about the experience of red when she leaves the room. She only comes to know an old fact in some different way.</p>

<p>The problem with this response is that it is difficult to distinguish between learning some old fact in a new way and learning some brand new fact. Consider the Batman case again. When you think about Batman, you think about a caped superhero with a dark voice, no superpowers, a utility belt, and access to advanced technology. Your concept of Batman includes these various features that you associate with him. Your concept of Bruce Wayne is different. When you think about Bruce, you think about a billionaire, orphaned young when his parents were killed, someone cared for by a butler, someone relatively carefree and irresponsible. When you learn that one person is both Bruce Wayne and Batman, you realize that one person has all the various features you had associated with both, e.g., he is both a caped superhero and an orphan. You have learned that you had two concepts all along for the same person. So it seems reasonable to say that 1 and 2 describe the one fact.</p>

<p>Might this explain what Mary learns when she leaves the room? Let us say that P is the property of being an experience of red. Before leaving the room, Mary might have one concept for P. Namely, she has a physical concept for P, a concept which has associated with it all the various physical facts she has learned in her studies. So Mary already knows that an experience of red has property P, but she conceptualizes P as a purely physical property. When Mary leaves the room, perhaps she does not learn some new fact, namely, that the experience of red has some property distinct from P. Perhaps all she learns is a new concept for P. If so, she does not learn a new fact, she only learns a new way of conceptualizing some fact. Similarly, you might also learn that you can use the concept of Batman to describe somebody you were already familiar with, Bruce Wayne.</p>

<p>But this seems very unrealistic. Mary doesn’t know any of the various qualitative properties of a red experience before leaving the room. That is, she doesn’t have some deep realization and say to herself, ‘I knew about some various qualitative properties and I knew all the physical facts about some experience P, but it’s only now that I know that the experience of P has these various qualitative properties.’ Mary has no idea what it’s like to experience color. Equivalently, if I don’t know anything at all about Bruce Wayne, it’s hard to say that I only come to learn some old fact in a new way when I learn that Bruce Wayne saved Gotham City. I have also learned some facts about Bruce Wayne! To put it another way, if I have no idea who Bruce Wayne is and learn on Tuesday that Bruce Wayne is Batman, then it looks like I do learn some new facts; this is different from being deeply familiar with both Bruce Wayne and Batman, and then learning that they are one and the same person. In the case I am describing, you have no knowledge of Bruce Wayne whatsoever. This is the situation that Mary is in. She does not have some deep familiarity with the qualitative properties of a red experience and then learns that these properties attach to certain states that can also be described in physical terms. She has no idea whatsoever about what red experiences are like until she leaves the room and sees red for the very first time.</p>
