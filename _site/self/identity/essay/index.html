  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>What a mystery! You are Jessica Jones, Hell’s Kitchen’s famous private detective. What a case they have thrown at you this time. You were asked to track down ‘The Mind’. The NYPD wanted to know who and what that thing is. They are in for a surprise. After carefully interrogating every eminent scientist and philosopher in NYC, those at Columbia, Cornell, NYU, and elsewhere, you have discovered that the Mind was hiding in plain sight all along. It is none other than ‘The Brain’. Mental states are numerically identical to brain states!</p>

<p>Those traditional cops in the NYPD probably won’t believe you; they are reluctant to accept unusual suggestions. So, you need to build your case. You will present the evidence that mental states  are numerically identical to brain states, that the mind and the brain are identical to one another, and you will try to anticipate and preemptively shut down their objections to your discovery.</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Write your case report to the NYPD. The case report must include <strong>all</strong> of the following:<br />
1. Explain what it means to say that mental states are <strong>numerically identical</strong> to brain states. Be careful here. Do not claim that they are merely correlated or that one causes the other. Clearly explain what it means for them to be  <strong>numerically identical</strong>. 
2. Present the best evidence for the claim that brains states are numerically identical to mental states. <br />
3. State <strong>one</strong> objection to the claim that mental states are numerically identical to brain states.
4. Respond to the objection.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to complete any of these tasks in your letter will result in a loss of points. In particular, failure to clearly explain what it means for mental states to be numerically identical to brain states will result in a loss of points; this is the most important claim of this week’s theory, so you need to explain it carefully.</p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.</p>
