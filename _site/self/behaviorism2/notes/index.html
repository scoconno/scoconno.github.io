  <h2 id="objections-to-behaviorism">Objections to Behaviorism</h2>

<p>Philosophical behaviorism claims that mental states are identical to sets of behaviors (or, perhaps, sets of dispositions to behave). On this view, a mental state of yours like surprise is not some internal and private state, observable directly only to you. Philosophical behaviorism claims that your surprise is merely the way you behave. And by ‘behave’, we recall that we distinguished two types of behavior,  <strong>physiological responses</strong> and <strong>bodily movements</strong>. Physiological responses are things like pupil dilation, sweating, grinding our teeth, raising our eyebrows,  etc. A bodily movement, on the other hand, is an observable motion of some or all parts of the body. These include extending and retracting our limbs, turning our head from left to right, etc. This image depicts the range of bodily movements that are characteristic of our species.</p>

<p><img src="movements.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>If philosophical behaviorism is true, then your surprise at, say, winning the lottery is not some feeling. It is merely some set of particular physiological responses and bodily movements, e.g., the raising of your eyebrows, the lifting of the corners of your lips, etc. In this handout, we survey some objections to this claim.</p>

<h2 id="couterexamples">Couterexamples</h2>

<p>Suppose that surprise is identical to raising eyebrows, upturning lips, and gasping. If this is correct, two things follows: 1) any entity which displays these behaviors feels surprise, and 2) any entity which is not displaying these behaviors is not feeling surprise. In other words, these behaviors would be <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficient</em> for feeling surprise. Here we can raise two distinct one objections, one to the claim that such behaviors are necessary for surprise and the other to the claim that such behaviors are sufficient for surprise.</p>

<p>Consider first those who are excellent at controlling their reactions and behaviors. Here is a picture of someone we could imagine just hearing the most incredible news but pretending not to be shocked.</p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/sIoYmnRIbFkt2" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/kate-hudson-sIoYmnRIbFkt2">via GIPHY</a></p>

<p>This woman is surprised by the news; she just chooses not to show it. If philosophical behaviorism were true, this would be impossible. It would be impossible to be surprised while suppressing surprised behavior. This seems very implausible. All of us have occasion to control our behaviors and reactions. Perhaps we don’t want to appear nervous in a job interview or seem too eager on a date. I try very hard to suppress some behavior in front of my one year old, e.g., I try not to show frustration or worry when he cries incessantly, I avoid showing my fear when we encounter a bug that gives me the shudders, etc. Likewise, while one person screams when they feel pain, another might bite their tongue and remain silent–perhaps they are training to be an army ranger and need to prove themselves. These are clear examples of having a mental state without displaying the associated behaviors. If philosophical behaviorism were true, this would be impossible; you could not have the mental state without behaving in the relevant way.</p>

<p>Again, if philosophical behaviorism is true, then anyone who displays the behavior identified with some mental state should, in fact, have that mental state. Our second objection says that it is possible to display the behaviors associated with a mental state without being in the state. Consider the advanced robot, Sophia.</p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:63%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/ZL0xs5uUg709a" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/speed-person-experience-ZL0xs5uUg709a">via GIPHY</a></p>

<p>Sophia here displays the behavior associated with joy, surprise, and disgust but is not in any of these mental states; robots can be made to behave as if they had mental states even though they do not. This would be impossible if philosophical behaviorism were true. If it were true, Sophia really would feel surprise, joy, and disgust just because she displays the associated behaviors. But this seems implausible. A similar problem arises with acting. Regardless of whether you have acted in a play, all of us have occasionally faked our reactions. I must act surprised during a game of peek-a-boo with my son even though I certainly don’t feel surprise. But if philosophical behaviorism were true, this would be impossible. If I act surprised, I really would be surprised.  Again, this seems implausible.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-of-our-own-minds">Knowledge of our own minds</h2>

<p>Behaviorism is driven by a desire to explain our knowledge of other minds, to explain how we know what others are feeling and thinking. Their explanation of this knowledge is simple: since mental states are identical to observable behaviors, we directly observe others’ mental states just by observing their behavior.</p>

<p>How does the behaviorist explain the knowledge we have of our own minds? I know that I am feeling tired from a long day of caring for my teething son. How do I know that I feel tired? If behaviorism were true, then all there is to my tiredness is the particular way I am behaving. It seems that the behaviorist must claim that I know that I am tired in exactly the same way as my wife knows it, i.e., by observing my behavior. This seem implausible.</p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xEzokqrvd59KM" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/television-gifset-living-single-xEzokqrvd59KM">via GIPHY</a></p>

<p>Consider this picture an analogy for the behaviorist’s explanation of self-knowledge. I would find out what mental state I am in by observing myself, e.g., I would find our I am confident by seeing myself act confidently in a mirror. But this seems wrong. We don’t need to observe our behavior to know how are feeling, e.g., I don’t need to look at myself grimacing in a mirror to know that I am in pain. Whether I am in pain, or want ice-cream, or hope for rain, seems to be something I can directly and immediately be aware of; I know I am in pain by introspecting and not by observing my behavior.</p>

<h2 id="mental-causation">Mental Causation</h2>

<p>Consider these two claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My Surprise is the cause of me arching my eyebrows, upturning my lips, and gasping.</li>
  <li>My surprise = arching my eyebrows, upturning my lips, and gasping.</li>
</ol>

<p>Behaviorists defend 2; they believe there is nothing more to surprise than the associated behaviors. If this correct, our surprise does not cause our surprised behavior; our mental states do not cause our behavior. Similarly, my pain does not cause me to grimace. My pain just is the grimacing. The grimacing is caused by, say, stubbing my toe, or spraining a muscle.</p>

<p>But this violates many of our standard intuitions about mental causation.  We think we buy the ice-cream because we want the ice-cream. We don’t think our desire is just the purchase. Again, we treat our partners well because we love them. Our love isn’t reducible to all the various ways we treat them. But if behaviorism is true, we are wrong to think these things. Our love, desires, pains, and hopes cannot be the cause of anything. They are just the ways we behave.</p>

<h2 id="mental-states-are-needed-to-define-mental-states">Mental states are needed to define mental states</h2>

<p>Our final objection claims that it is impossible to say what behavior is associated with what mental state without making assumptions about what other mental states the person has. I am not going to provide any notes on this objection as this week’s essay will be examining your comprehension of Kim’s presentation of it. See <em>Difficulties with Behavioral Definitions</em> in chapter 3.</p>
