  <h2 id="objections-to-behaviorism">Objections to Behaviorism</h2>

<p>You could present two problems: 1) mental states don’t reliably correlate with certain behavior, and 2) certain behaviors don’t reliably correlate with certain mental states.</p>

<p>Behaviorism is a powerful theory that had many defenders, but it has fallen out of favor for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Causation</strong>
If behaviorism is true, mental states do not cause anything. For instance, my pain does not cause me to grimace. My pain just is the grimacing. The grimacing is caused by, say, stubbing my toe, or spraining a muscle. But we ordinarily think that behavior is caused by our mental states. We think we buy the ice-cream because we want the ice-cream. We don’t think our desire is just the purchase. Again, we treat our partners well because we love them. Our love isn’t reducible to all the various ways we treat them. But if behaviorism is true, we are wrong to think these things. Our love, desires, pains, and hopes cannot be the cause of anything. They are just the ways we behave.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge of our own minds</strong>
The behaviorist nicely explains our knowledge of others’ mental states, but they cannot explain knowledge of our own mental states. We don’t need to observe our behavior to know how we’re feeling, e.g., I don’t need to look at myself grimacing in a mirror to know that I am in pain. Whether I’m in pain, or want ice-cream, or hope for rain, seems to be a matter of what’s going on in me right now, which I can be directly aware of. It doesn’t seem to be a matter of how I would act in certain hypothetical situations. But if behaviorism is true, it would be a matter about how I act in hypothetical scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Single mental states do not have distinctive behaviors</strong>
The behaviorist claims that each mental state is associated with some distinctive behaviors. But this seems implausible. One person screams when they feel pain. Another person bites their tongue and remains silent–perhaps they are training to be an army ranger and need to prove themselves. But if behaviorism is true, we would expect the same behavior for every mental state.</p>

<p>Another way of raising this problem is to note that it is difficult to say what behavior is associated with what mental state without making assumptions about what other mental states the person has. Consider the behaviorist’s account of wanting ice-cream. X wants ice-cream if and only if:</p>

<ol>
  <li>X is disposed to read the dessert menu before reading the main menu–this assumes that X does not want food from the main menu, so we need to assume a want when analyzing X’ want for ice-cream.</li>
  <li>X is disposed to purchase ice-cream if given a voucher for ice-cream–this depends on whether X believes that the voucher will work, whether X intends to keep his weight in check, etc. So, here we have explained what it is to want ice-cream by appealing to more mental states like belief and intent.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that we can’t describe behavior in purely physical terms. So, we can’t describe the behavior associated with a mental state in purely physical terms. For instance, the behavior associated with the desire for ice-cream can’t just be making certain noises. It has to be making those noises intentionally and sincerely, i.e., while having other mental states. But if the behaviorist says this, then he’s no longer talking about purely physical behavior.</p>

<p>Hence, the behaviorist faces a dilemma. Either he says that creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such purely physical behavior. But then the claims he makes won’t be plausible. There is no single physical way in which all creatures who are in pain behave.  Alternatively, the behaviorist can say creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such mentalistic behavior. But if the behaviorist says this, then he hasn’t succeeded in reducing mental facts to purely physical facts.</p>
