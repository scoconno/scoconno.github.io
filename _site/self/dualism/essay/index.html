  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>That Descartes! You hired him as your personal tutor. You are Queen Christina of Sweden and he should be happy with that position. But his argument with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia is causing a diplomatic mess. In a series of highly public letters, she has argued against his substance dualism, which she claims is unable to accommodate the obvious fact that minds interact with bodies. He has responded vigorously and now even the King of France has taken an interest. He’s far too powerful to ignore, so you decide to write a letter to him to explain the dispute between Descartes and Elisabeth. Hopefully, you can show him that it is truly a philosophical one. Rulers and politicians can stay out of it. In your letter, you explain substance dualism and why Descartes believes it is true. You then explain Elisabeth’s objection to substance dualism.</p>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Write a <strong>letter</strong>–it should have an address, salutation, etc.— to the King of France in which you do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explain substance dualism. Make sure to explain the basic concept of a substance as well as explain what it means to say that there are both mental and physical substances.</li>
  <li>Explain Descartes’ basic argument for substance dualism. You don’t need to discuss every argument. Just pick the strongest and explain it. Make sure to explain the evidence/premises of the argument. Don’t just cite the conclusion.</li>
  <li>Explain Princess Elisabeth’s argument against substance dualism.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include either of these elements in your letter will result in a loss of points.</p>

<p>Please find a sample response <a href="sample.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.</p>
