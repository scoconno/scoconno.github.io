  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The year is 2042. The President is unhappy. Sam Miller was elected in 2038, but citizens everywhere claim that they did not vote for him. There has been dramatic changes in the last four years. Many citizens have upgraded their biological limbs with superior mechanical ones. The advent of the technicolor appearance modifier has allowed people to change their skin, eye, and hair color, and to make changes every day. Still others availed of new bone molding technology that allowed them to shrink, grow, and change the shape of their bones. The changes are so drastic that those who voted in 2038 can hardly be strictly identical to anyone who exists now, or so people claim. These dissenters are lead by Gretchen Weirob - Miller’s former campaign manager.</p>

<p>Drastic times call for drastic measures. Miller challenges Weirob to a televised discussion. Weirob argues that she is not numerically identical to any voter from 2038 given that nobody from 2038 sufficiently resembles her. Miller responds by arguing that people can change dramatically while remaining numerically identical because personal identity consists in either sameness of soul or psychological continuity [you will pick one of these views].</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charitably explaining arguments for views that are not your own.</li>
  <li>Explaining difficult concepts in your own words.</li>
  <li>Understanding the difference between qualitative similarity and numerical identity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Write a transcript of the debate between Miller and Weirob. The dialog must contain the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An explanation of the puzzle of personal identity. Why does Weirob deny that she is identical to anyone from four years ago?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NB:</strong> Your paper must demonstrate a proper understanding of the difference between qualitative similarity (qualitative identity) and numerical identity. Failure to do so will result in loss of points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An attempt to solve this puzzle with Miller appealing to <strong>either</strong> sameness of soul or psychological continuity.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NB:</strong> Miller must pick one of these views to explain personal identity. This assignment is not asking you to discuss each possible response to the puzzle. Failure to ignore this instruction will result in a loss of points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An identification of one problem for the proposed solution, i.e., Weirob should raise an objection to Miller’s supposed solution.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will result in a loss of points.</p>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>
