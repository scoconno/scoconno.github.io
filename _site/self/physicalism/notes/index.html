  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Recall that there are two distinct questions about consciousness:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is consciousness? What are its features? How best can they be described?</li>
  <li>How does consciousness come to exist? If from the brain, how so?</li>
</ol>

<p>Our first question asks us to identify the defining features of consciousness. Should it be characterized as mere awareness of the external world? If not, what else is it? Is there just one phenomenon of consciousness or might there be several different phenomena that we use the same word to describe? If so, what are these different phenomena? The last two weeks focused on this questions. This week, we will focus on the second question, in particular, we will ask how, if at all, consciousness could be produced by our brains.</p>

<p>It is mysterious how our brains could produce consciousness. A 19th century biologist expresses his puzzlement as follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what consciousness is, we know not; and how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story, or as any other ultimate fact of nature (Huxley).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Humans are conscious and our consciousness has something to do with our brains. But what is that ‘something’? Just how could a brain produce consciousness in the first place? A Djin appears when Aladdin rubs the magic lamp. Consciousness appear when our neurons fire the right way. Huxley believes that this appearance of consciousness is as mysterious as the magic described in the story of Aladdin. The problem, in part, is that our brain states seem so completely unlike the consciousness they seem to produce. Put a brain under a microscope. You will not see anything like the rich range of conscious experiences you enjoy.</p>

<p>We begin our discussion of this topic with an explanation of this mystery: we are mistaken to think that consciousness is a physical thing. Just like we are mistaken to think that a Djin could arise from any lamp, so too we are mistaken to think consciousness could arise from our brains. This view, that consciousness is not a physical phenomena, has been best defended by Frank Jackson with what is called ‘The knowledge Argument.’ The argumen aims to establish that conscious experience involves non-physical properties. It rests on the idea that someone who has complete physical knowledge about another conscious being might yet lack knowledge about how it feels to have the experiences of that being.</p>

<h2 id="physicalism">Physicalism</h2>

<p>Jackson targets his argument against <em>physicalism</em>. I will first explain what this is before discussing the details of his argument.</p>

<p>Physicalism is a general theory about everything that exists. It says that the everything that exists is physical. If phyiscalism is true, then God can exist only if she is physical. So too numbers can exist only if they are physical. If they are not physical, they don’t exist according to this theory. What do physicalists mean by saying that everything is physical? Here is a simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dot-matrix picture has global properties — it is symmetrical, it is cluttered, and whatnot — and yet all there is to the picture is dots and non-dots at each point of the matrix. The global properties are nothing but patterns in the dots. They supervene: no two pictures could differ in their global properties without differing, somewhere, in whether there is or there isn’t a dot (Lewis, 1986, p. 14).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The analogy Lewis uses to illustrate this relies on a dot-matrix. You probably have seen one of these before:</p>

<p><img src="dot1.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="dot2.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The pattern in both pictures supervenes on the dots. This means that all the features of the pictures are explained by various features of the dots. To see this, notice that if you change the dots, you will change the picture. Similarly, you cannot change the picture without changing the dots. The dots are more fundamental than the picture: the picture only exists because the dots are pressed various ways. Notice also that every single property of the picture can be explained by properties of the dots. The reason why the nose is a certain length is because the relevant dots are separated from one another by a particular length.</p>

<p>Physicalists claim that all of reality is like this dot matrix picture. They think that fundamental physical features of reality correspond to the dots. These features include properties like mass and location. Everything else is nothing more than a pattern in the features of the fundamental physical things. On this view, all biological, chemical, psychological, and social features, etc., of the world are nothing but a kind of pattern of the fundamental entities. This entails that there are no biological, chemical, or social changes without a change in the fundamental things. If a heart stops pumping blood, some change will have occurred in the fundamental things that compose that heart. If some nation changes its laws, some change will have occurred in what ultimately nations are composed of, e.g., the people who make up a nation will enact various laws because of some change in the ultimate fundamental things that compose them.</p>

<p>If this doesn’t quite make sense, here is another simple way of understanding the main idea: scientists are trying to identify the most fundamental building blocks of matter, e.g., quarks, bosons, etc. Physicalists claim that <em>everything</em> that exists is either one of these most basic bits of matter are some kind of pattern in the most basic bits of matter. If physicalism were true, we could eventually replace all disciplines with the study of particle physics; the study of the basic building blocks of reality would tell us everything there is to know about everything that exists, including biology, sociology, psychology, art, etc.</p>

<p>If physicalism is true, then every fact you learn will be a physical fact. Consider what this means about studying some object like a heart. When you learn everything there is to know about the heart, you learn every fact about the heart. If physicalism is true, each of those facts you learned is a physical fact. Remember, the heart on this view is nothing more than a pattern in the most fundamental physical things.</p>

<p>If physicalism is true, then each fact about human mentality is also a physical fact. This is a dramatic claim. Consider the implication it has for the topics we  have focused on in this course. We first investigated personal identity. We asked under what conditions a person existing at one time is identical to a person existing at another. If physicalism is true, then personal identity consists in some physical facts. This precludes the possibility that personal identity consists in sameness of soul, an essentially non-physical entity. It also means that personal identity consists in psychological continuity only if facts about our psychologies are physical ones.</p>

<p>Physicalism also has significant implications for investigation of the mind-body problem. It shows that substance dualism is false and gives much support for the mind-brain identity theory. For instance, physicalism entails that the facts about your experience of red, your feeling of pain and pleasure, your dreaming of ice-cream, your hoping for a fulfilling job, etc., are physical facts. If you learn about the inner workings of your mind, then you have learned some physical facts; the facts about the inner workings of your mind must be physical ones.</p>

<h2 id="franks-jacksons-knowledge-argument">Frank’s Jackson’s Knowledge Argument</h2>

<p>Is physicalism true? Many have claimed that at least some facts about our minds are not physical ones; there are some facts about the mind that are neither fundamental physical facts nor supervene on the fundamental physical facts. If this is true, our consciousness is not explained by any features of our brains or what compose our brains. The most famous argument against physicalism was offered  by Frank Jackson. He motivates it with the simple following thought-experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like ‘red’, ‘blue’, and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal chords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘The sky is blue’.… What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then is it inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false. (Jackson, 1982)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is called the ‘Knowledge Argument’. It aims to show that experience involves non-physical facts, and it rests on the idea that Mary, a super scientist, can have complete physical knowledge about some experience, but lack knowledge about what that experience is like “from the inside.” If she lacks suck knowledge, then something about our minds is essentially non-physical.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-mary-know">What does Mary know?</h2>

<p>Let us go through the argument in detail. Jackson first asks us to imagine a super-scientist, Mary. Mary has spent her life in a black and white room. Thus, she has never experienced red first hand. She has never seen the redness of a tomato, the red hue of a startling sunset, etc.</p>

<p><img src="Mary2.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="Mary1.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>While Mary cannot see red, she has advanced technology that allows her to study what happens in other peoples’ brains when they experience red. So we can imagine that she is studying a subject, John, who reports that he is seeing red right now. Mary can study his brain and learn everything physical there is to know about John’s experience of red. So, what does she know about John’s experience of red?</p>

<p><img src="Reflect.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>First, she knows that there are different wavelengths of light, and she knows which wavelengths of light are reflected by which surfaces.</p>

<p><img src="eye.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Second, she knows all the following facts about the eye:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are light-sensitive cells in the retina, some shaped like rods and some shaped like cones.</li>
  <li>Both rods and cones detect light.</li>
  <li>There are three types of cones, one type detects short wavelengths, one detects medium wavelengths, and the other detects long wavelengths.</li>
  <li>The rods and cones process the light into nerve impulses and pass them along to the cortex of the brain via the optic nerve.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="optic.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Third, Mary knows that there is an optic nerve and knows how the optic nerve transmits information about the wavelengths detected in the retina to the central nervous system.</p>

<p><img src="nueron1.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="neuron2.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Finally, Mary knows which neurons in John’s brain are activated by each wavelength and knows how those neurons are activated.</p>

<h2 id="the-billion-dollar-question">The Billion Dollar Question</h2>

<p>Suppose that Mary has been studying the mind of someone who sees red. She knows everything that I have just outlined. Suppose that Mary leaves the room for the very first time and sees, say, a red apple. Does Mary learn anything new about the experience of red when she leaves the room? Here’s an oddly creepy video that explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZy3Ky9y_fg">two answers.</a></p>

<p>If Mary learns something new, then physicalism is false. Recall that Mary knows all the physical facts before leaving the room. So, if she learns something new upon leaving it, then that new fact is not a physical fact. Jackson thinks that Mary clearly does learn something new. She knows what it is like to see red! Jackson thinks that knowing what it is like to see red is clearly some fact we can learn. He also thinks it is a fact that Mary cannot learn by just learning the physical facts about the experience of red.</p>

<p>Let’s say that Mary was studying John’s vision of red and present Jackson’s argument somewhat formally:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>P1:</strong> If physicalism is true, all the facts about John’s experience of red are physical facts.</li>
  <li><strong>P2:</strong> Mary knows all the <strong>physical facts</strong> about John’s experience of red before her release.</li>
  <li><strong>P3:</strong> Thus, if physicalism is true, Mary knows <strong>all the facts</strong> about John’s experience of red before her release.</li>
  <li><strong>P4:</strong> Mary learns some <strong>new fact</strong>, F, about John’s experience of red upon her release.</li>
  <li><strong>P5:</strong> F is <strong>not a physical fact</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>P6:</strong> Thus, Mary does not know <strong>all the facts</strong> about John’s experience of red before her release.</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Physicalism is false.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-different-version-of-the-argument">A different version of the argument</h2>

<p><img src="Fred.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Instead of asking whether Mary learns something new upon her release, we can ask whether we would learn something new in the following scenario: suppose that Fred returns from a mission to space and reports a significant change in his perceptual experience. He says that he now sees a strange new color completely unlike anything he experienced before leaving Earth. He can see what is called a forbidden color–yellow-blue! What’s more, he sees this color every time he looks at a blank piece of paper that appears white to everyone else. Suppose we study the physics of color and the neuroscience of color vision. We are tasked with studying Fred’s yellow-blue perception. We learn everything about the relevant wavelength, cones, neurons, etc. Would we thereby know everything there is to know about Fred’s experience of yellow-blue? If we did, then we would learn nothing new by seeing yellow-blue for the first time when our eyes too are changed by a trip to space.</p>
