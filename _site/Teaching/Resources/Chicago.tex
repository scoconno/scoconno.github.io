\section{Citing sources in your text}
There are several different citation styles. Here are the three main ones: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item MLA - calls for parenthetical citations in the main body of the text.
\item APA - calls for parenthetical citations in the main body of the text. 
\item Chicago - calls for citations in footnotes or endnotes. 
\end{enumerate}
You need to pick a style and stick to it. Don't mix and match!  I provide a few details on Chicago, but you can find full guides here:\\ http://olinuris.library.cornell.edu/ref/bibcitations.html
\begin{description}
\item[INSIDER TIP] There are software packages that will manage your citations and bibliographies automatically, e.g. BibTeX, Refworks, etc. It does take time to learn how to use this kind of software, but it is much more efficient over time. If you already know a mark-up language, I recommend that you learn \LaTeX and use BibTeX.

\section{Chicago}
\begin{itemize}
\item Put a superscript number in your text corresponding to the number of the note. 
\item Place the citation information at the bottom of the page (for footnotes) or place all citations together on an endnotes page.
\item The first time you cite a work, provide full information. All subsequent citations from the same work are done with abbreviations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{First citation} 

\begin{description}
\item[Book] Footnote number, First Name Last Name, Title of Book (Place of
Publication: Publisher, Year), page number.


\item[Article] Footnote number, First Name Last Name, ``Title of Article,'' Title of
Journal Volume Number (Year): pages.



\item[Website] Footnote number, Name of Author (or Corporate Author), Title of
Website, Date Posted on Web, <URL> (Date you accessed the site).

\end{description}

\subsection{Subsequent citations}
Subsequent footnoted references to a work you've already cited in full need only the author's last name and the number of the page or pages cited.

\section{Making a Bibliography}
Your bibliography should follow your endnotes page (if you're using endnotes instead of footnotes). Alphabetize the list of sources by author's last name or first important word of title. If an entry is more than one line long, indent each additional line one tabspace.

\begin{description}
\item[Book] Last name, First name. Title. Place of Publication: Publishing Company, Year.
\item[Journal Article] Last name, First name. ``Article Title.'' Journal Title Volume Number (Year): pages
\item[Website] Name of author or Corporate author. ``Title of Individual Webpage'' Title of Entire Website. Date of posting. <URL> (Date you accessed the site).
