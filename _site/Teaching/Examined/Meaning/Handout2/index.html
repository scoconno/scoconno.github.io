      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Recall Tolstoy’s question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… My question - that which at the age of fifty brought me to the verge of suicide - was the simplest of questions, lying in the soul of every man from the foolish child to the wisest elder: it was a question without an answer to which one cannot live, as I had found by experience. It was: “What will come of what I am doing today or shall do tomorrow? What will come of my whole life?” (Tolstoy, p.14) <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Differently expressed, the question is: “Why should I live, why wish for anything, or do anything?” It can also be expressed thus: “Is there any meaning in my life that the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy? (Tolstoy, p.14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recall that life has meaning only if it has significant value or purpose over time, where this value makes life choice worthy. There are two different ways of understanding this value:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Internal Value:</strong> the value or purpose that comes when people see their goals or purposes as inherently valuable or worthwhile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>External Value:</strong> Meaning or purpose that comes from outside of ourselves in relationship to something that we may or may not be aware of.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When we ask about the meaning of life, we are asking about internal value. We are asking why we should feel that there is something in our lives that makes them worthwhile. Is there any project or goal that could make our lives choice worthy, could shape our psychology so dramatically that we are motivated to get up in the morning, keep going, and find all the trials and tribulations of life worthwhile?</p>

<p>Pessimists, recall, claim that life is not choice worthy. Their argument:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Life is choice worthy only if it has internal value.</li>
  <li>Life has internal value only if life has external value.</li>
  <li>Life has no external value.</li>
  <li>Life has no internal value (from 1–3).</li>
  <li>Life is not choice worthy (from 1 &amp; 4).</li>
</ol>

<p>We saw that Tolstoy argues for Premise 2 and 3 by way of a fable:</p>

<p><img src="/Teaching/Examined/Meaning/Tolstoy.jpg" alt="The sweetness of life?" /></p>

<p>The argument for Premise 2 seems to be a point about human psychology. Humans, Tolstoy, assumes cannot sustain an interest in a long term project, make sacrifices towards achieving it, and allow it do its jobs unless they come to see it as having external value.</p>

<p>Premise 2 is a point about impermanence. In order for a project to be</p>

<p>Tolstoy did not commit suicide. He subsequently</p>

<p>This argument is valid; the conclusion follows form the premises. Optimists, however, object that it is not sound.  There are two versions of optimism. The first accepts 1 and 2, but rejects 3. They find an external value to life in religion. The second type of optimist accepts 3, that life has no external value, but denies that internal value depends on there being external value (denies 1). The first type of optimism is associated with Theism, the second with Atheism. You can find further discussion of each in the textbook. I provide a few extra details about the first here.</p>

<h2 id="theism">Theism</h2>

<p>Tolstoy did not remain depressed. He reports meeting and talking with rural farmers at a time in Russia when farmers lived a menial existence. They had nothing. Yet Tolstoy sees in these rural farmers an acceptance of life’s vicissitudes. Reclaiming his faith, he realized that he had found value in the wrong things. His art, his family, etc., could never provide the meaning he had sought. But God, an eternal perfect being, could provide that value. Tolstoy comes to accept the following two claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A human’s life has external meaning only because it is part of God’s plan, a grand cosmic order that encompasses every entity in the universe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A human’s life can have internal meaning if they align their life—their goals, projects, ambitions—with God’s plan. That is, life will be choice worthy if you can identify God’s plan for you and set about realizing that plan.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="meaning--christianity">Meaning &amp; Christianity</h2>

<p>Tolstoy doesn’t detail how Christianity construes the meaning of life. He merely says that if you believe that God exists, then you can see that your life has some external value. But can we say something more about what this external value consists in?</p>

<p>At this point, Christians point to one person who, they claim, had a meaningful life. Jesus’s live shows us that God cares about human lives; Jesus was sent to save mankind. Reflecting on the details of his life, we might say that Jesus’s life had the following meaning:</p>

<p><strong>Teleological Value:</strong> His life had a purpose. All of Jesus’ life involves suffering for the sake of man kind. All the aspects of his life were organized around this one overarching purpose.</p>

<p>Christianity also emphasizes other characters with God given purposes. Noah, the Saints, the Apostles, are all individuals who were supposedly given important jobs by God. These tasks, these jobs, give their life external value according to Christianity. Their lives also had internal value because they identified their God given purposes, saw them as worthwhile, and devoted their time and energy to realizing them.</p>

<h2 id="objection">Objection</h2>

<p>Here I briefly raise a problem for this account of the meaning of life. Suppose we grant that the lives of Jesus, Noah, the other Saints had external value because each of them had a God given purpose. It does not thereby follow that each human has a God given purpose and some of the candidates for this purpose are unsatisfactory:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions 1:</strong> Our purpose is to serve God. This is a very natural suggestion. A Theist might claim that we were created by God to do his will. That would seem to give our lives the significance we desired. The problem, though, is that being in service to someone is not obviously a thing we would always choose. Granted, if God created us to serve him, then our lives would be significant to God. But notice that bees are significant to the bee keeper, yet that hardly shows us why a bee should find its own life significant.</p>

<p>To motivate this objection, consider the very far fetched idea that God created us to perform a very specific role. Once our species has grown large enough, he will signal to an alien race to move to Earth where they will now find a new rich food source. Us! If this were the case, God would have crated us to be the food in some alien’s hamburger. We would have a role in his grand design. We would even know what it is. I doubt, though, that anyone would be happy to find out that they were created as food for some superior being. A menial role in a stage designed for another does not make life choice worthy.</p>

<p>There is a second worry with the claim that God created us to serve him. Recall that God is all loving, all knowing, and all powerful. If he is all loving, he would never have created us merely to serve him, especially since our lives involve so much suffering and pain. Suppose that we had the ability to create a a new fully conscious species. It is only an evil creator that would create such beings to suffer and toil in servitude to them.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion 2:</strong> The existence of God shows that we have a purpose. He is all loving, therefore he would never have created us without a purpose. However, since he is all loving, he would never have created us merely to serve him. Nevertheless, we do not know why he created us, to what end he intended our lives to serve.</p>

<p>The suggestion merely avoids answering the question at hand. How, if at all, would the existence of God provide life with external meaning?</p>

<p>By themselves, these objections do not completely undermine the Theist’s account of the meaning of life. What they do, however, is show that belief in God should not in itself be comforting. For God’s existence to be comforting, we need to know why he created us, to what end our lives serve. Unless those details are forthcoming, the unsettling possibility is left open that he created us for reasons that none of us should be happy to live with.</p>

<h2 id="atheism">Atheism</h2>

<p>Our second optimistic approach to the meaning of life rejects the need for external value altogether. These optimists ask us to consider the lives of people who clearly lead meaningful lives. If we can identify why we think those lives valuable, we might be able to decide how, we ourselves, can live meaningful lives.</p>

<p>Who has lived a meaningful life? M.L.K, Gandhi, Einstein, Leonardo Di Vinci are clear candidates. Can we see anything similar to their lives? Each of them seemed to pursue some goal with a single minded rigor. The following are important:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Life had some dominant, over-all goal which gave direction to a great many of the individual’s actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actions were performed with a special zest that was not present before the person became attached to his goal or would not have been present if that person had no such goal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Wolf wants to give an account of what it is that makes an individual life meaningful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>She begins by shooting down an alternate account. She doesn’t think that a life is meaningful iff it satisfies a subjective criteria like making the person happy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paradigm cases of meaningful lives—Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Einstein, for example are not particularly happy lives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, paradigm cases of meaningless lives-The Blob, for example-are actually filled with a good amount of subjective happiness and contentedness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>Wolf’s account:</dt>
  <dd>A meaningful life is one that is a) actively and at least somewhat b) successfully engaged in a project (or projects) of c) positive value.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are three cases clauses to this definition that require defense.</p>

<h2 id="active-vs-non-active-life">Active vs. Non-Active Life</h2>

<p>Consider the cases of people whose lives are useless due to a lack of activity: The Blob and the idle rich. Such lives seems useless. Wolfs asks us to conclude, with her, that a meaningful life must be one of active engagement.</p>

<h2 id="actively-engaged-in-a-wrong-project">Actively engaged in a wrong project.</h2>

<p>Consider cases in which a life, though actively engaged, is wasted on a project without any positive value. Someone might decide adopt as their life project the task of counting the number of grains of sand on Sandy Hook beach. Someone might decide to take as their project the task of everyday digging a hole and re-filling it. These projects seems worthless. A life devoted to them cannot be a meaningful one.</p>

<p>So a meaningful life is one whose projects are of some positive value.</p>

<h2 id="success-vs-non-success">Success vs. non-Success</h2>

<p>Consider cases in which the project around which somebody has organized their life is revealed to be bankrupt, e.g., the inventor who devotes their life to creating an automated car only to be beaten to the punch by Google. Or, perhaps, the scientist whose break-through is scooped. Or the author who devotes decades to writing the biography of some figure only to see someone else beat them to it. Or the CEO who spends a life developing a business that is superseded by new technologies, e.g., the CEO of a nuclear power plant company that ends up seeing nuclear power replaced by solar power.</p>

<p>These lives are clearly tragic. There’s something miserable about devoting your life to a project that never sees fruition. So, Wolf claims, that the projects must be succesful for our lives to be meaningful. We must be able to succeed if they are to be meaningful.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>`Projects’ should be taken broadly to include any kind of ongoing activity or involvement. The projects engage the person — they should see them as constituting part of what their life is about. The projects must actually have positive value. It is not enough that the individual believes that their projects have positive value. Else, we could not make sense of awakenings in which somebody comes to realize that their life to date has been without meaning, since their projects lack any positive value. Since, then, what the person would supposedly realize would be that their life hasn’t seemed meaningful–but surely, that’s not what people are realizing in such awakenings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The positive value need not be moral value. Having given an account of what people want when they want meaning in their lives, Wolf next considers whether or not meaning is something that we ought to want in our lives. Reasons for doubt:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meaningful lives are not necessarily moral lives, nor do they necessarily make the lives of others better—nor do they necessarily make the person whose life is meaningful better off.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wolf’s answer: we should want our lives to be actively engaged with projects of positive objective value—as opposed to projects which are merely subjectively valuable—because to do otherwise is to fail to recognize that one is but a small speck in a vast, value-filled universe. It is to fail to recognize that many things besides one’s own life have objective value.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wolf could be claiming that the only real candidate is when you see a project as having genuine objective value. Not sure about success. Maybe, you have to see yourself as having some genuine success. If you see it as valuable just to you, then you might have difficulty sustaining it.</p>
