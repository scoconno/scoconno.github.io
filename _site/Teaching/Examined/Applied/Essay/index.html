<h3 id="prompt">Prompt</h3>

<p>Applied Ethicists are more concerned with particular, practical cases than with more abstract theoretical questions. They want to know how, if at all, a hospital should distribute donated organs, whether it is permissible to bribe officials in foreign states to do business, etc. The questions listed above are all hot topics in the United States. Your job will be to answer your question as an Applied Ethicist. To do so, you need to think both about the effects your issue has on society as a whole as well as the effect it has on individuals within that assignment. Your assignment comes in three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>After researching articles at www.nj.com, identify some specific individual who has been affected by your chosen issue. Detail the real life downsides and benefits to that person, their friends, and their families. What would the benefits and downsides have been if the event had not occurred? Back up your answer with evidence from the newspaper articles. (400–600 words)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After researching articles at www.nj.com from the last 5 years, outline the major downsides and benefits of the current policy governing your chosen issue for society as a whole. What are the likely major downsides and benefits for society as a whole if the  policy is changed? Provide full citations to the newspaper articles. (400–600 words)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the information that you presented in the first two parts of your paper, state your answer to the question and explain how the information from the first two parts of the paper influenced your answer. (200–400 words)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="grade-breakdown">Grade Breakdown</h3>

<p>This paper is worth 20 points towards your final grade. 8 points will be awarded towards the first part of the paper, 8 parts towards the second, and 4 parts towards the third.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as either a word file or simple .rtf file will also suffice.</p>
