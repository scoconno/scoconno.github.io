<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a Signature Assignment File</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Include the following prompt for your assignment at the top of the assignment.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>After researching articles at www.nj.com, identify some specific individual who has been affected by your chosen issue. Detail the real life downsides and benefits to that person, their friends, and their families. What would the benefits and downsides have been if the event had not occurred? Back up your answer with evidence from the newspaper articles. (600–800 words)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>After researching articles at www.nj.com from the last 5 years, outline the major downsides and benefits of the current policy governing your chosen issue for society as a whole. What are the likely major downsides and benefits for society as a whole if the policy is changed? Provide full citations to the newspaper articles. (600–800 words)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Given the information that you presented in the first two parts of your paper, state your answer to the question and explain how the information from the first two parts of the paper influenced your answer. (400–600 words)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Do not include your name, my name, or the course title in your signature assignment file(s) or filename(s).</li>
  <li>I will be able to see who you are on Tk20 but the assessment team will not.</li>
  <li>Your response should begin after the prompt.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Upload and Submit Your Assignment</p>

<ul>
  <li>Log in to GothicNet and navigate to the Tk-20 folder in the Main Menu.</li>
  <li>Select the Tk-20 Higher Ed link.</li>
  <li>Inside Tk20, select Current Courses.</li>
  <li>Upload your Signature Assignments once for each learning goal. The two goals are ‘Critical Thnking’ and ‘Written Communication’.</li>
</ul>
