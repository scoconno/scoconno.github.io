      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>‘The Walking Dead’ is a piece of science fiction. It depicts a post-apocalyptic future where zombies run amok and a few survivors bandy together for mutual protection. Since fiction often provides such extreme cases, it can be useful to help us clarify the ethical theories that we are discussing this week. We can ask what the ethical thing would be to do in a variety of situations depicted in shows like the Walking Dead.</p>

<p>In the short clip I link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbn1wELZlB8">here</a>, Carol, one of the main characters, makes a difficult choice. She kills Lizzie, a girl who Carol had become a mother to. Lizzie has suffered a serious psychiatric break. She considered the zombies to be misunderstood creatures, different from humans, but still alive and entitled to be treated with respect. This belief led Lizzie to risk the lives of those around her. After unsuccessfully trying to help Lizzie, Carol feels forced to kill her after Lizzie decided to turn another girl into a zombie. Watch Lizzie’s breakdown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GitS306EyBQ">here.</a></p>

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>

<p>Write two short paragraphs evaluating Carol’s behavior. In the first paragraph, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Consequentialist. In the second, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Deontologist.</p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>500-750. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h2>

<p>Evaluating Carol’s action with an ethical theory requires you to a) decide whether that theory would judge the action moral, immoral, or neither, and b) explain why the ethical theory would make that evaluation. In doing both, you will need to be as specific as possible.</p>

<p>Points for this assignment are distributed equally across the two paragraphs.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<p>Please submit the file as a Microsoft Word file through Blackboard.</p>
