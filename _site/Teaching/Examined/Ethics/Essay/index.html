      <h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<p>Critically evaluate the Cultural Differences Argument for Cultural Relativism.</p>

<h3 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h3>

<p>This essay covers material contained on pp.123-141. Your essay should contain the following three parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>An explanation of cultural relativism. In this part, you will explain what claim the cultural relativist argues for. Do not at this point try explain the argument. Students regularly lose points in this respect. I will illustrate the mistake as follows: suppose I ask you to describe the city of Atlanta and you respond by telling me about the variety of different ways of getting to Atlanta. You’ve missed the mark. Similarly, your job in this part is explain the conclusion of the argument for Cultural Relativism. It’s not to explain how we get to that conclusion.</li>
  <li>An identification and explanation of the premises of the argument. Here your job is to explain how we get the conclusion. Don’t merely state the premises. Your job is to discuss each one. Give illustrations. I suggest a short paragraph per premise.</li>
  <li>Your assessment of the argument. Here I will be examining you on your grasp of the material from ch.1.3. You must decide whether the argument is valid and sound.</li>
</ol>
