<p>This assignment concerns <a href="/Teaching/Examined/Ethics/Kirinyaga.epub">‘Kirinyaga’, ch. 1, by Mike Resnik</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NB.</strong> You will need to open this file with software that can read ePubs. iBooks for macs works great. Calibre for pcs is a good option. Both are free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Koriba strangles a newborn child. He claims that the traditions of his people, the Kikuyu, say it is morally required of him to do so. Maintenance is concerned. They send Barbara Eaton to investigate. In this assignment, pretend to be Barbara Eaton and write that report. The report must explain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conditions on the ground. What did you see? Did people seem happy, healthy, etc?</li>
  <li>How were you received?</li>
  <li>How did Koriba explain his strangling of the child?</li>
  <li>How did Koriba respond when you claimed it was immoral to kill the child?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>500-750. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Please submit the file as a Microsoft Word file through Blackboard.</p>
