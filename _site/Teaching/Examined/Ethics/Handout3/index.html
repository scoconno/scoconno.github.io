      <h2 id="deontology">Deontology</h2>

<p><img src="/Teaching/Examined/Ethics/Slide1.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Recall again our diagram. The consequentialist, we have seen, claims that the effects, and only the effects, are relevant in determining the morality of our actions. They deny that any facts about the person are relevant. On the one hand, Deontologist agree that the morality of our actions has nothing to with the intentions, beliefs, conscience of the actor. But they also deny that effects have anything to do with the morality of our actions. They protest that consequentialism ignores a core feature of morality; we have a duty to do the right thing and a responsibility to avoid the wrong thing regardless of the consequences. Actions, on this view, are right or wrong independently of their effects, production of happiness, peopleâ€™s aims, or their desires and feelings.</p>

<p>To introduce you to this view, distinguish between two types of value, inherent vs. relational value. Relational value is value something has only in virtue of its relationship to something else that is valuable. Money has only relational value. It is valuable only in relation to what you can buy with it. If the human race were to go extinct, but our money remain, that money would not be something valuable. Health, on the other hand, is valuable in and of itself. Of course, being healthy helps us pursue other things that are valuable. But many pursue health for no other reason than to be healthy. The explanation for why we should be healthy is just that health is in itself valuable.</p>

<p>When determining the morality of our actions we need to decide whether rightness and wrongness are inherent or relational values. Is murder wrong, something to avoid, just because of its relation to something else? Or is murder something that should be avoided just because of what it is in itself?</p>

<p>The Consequentialists think that actions are only right or wrong relationally, that is, only in relation to the effects they produce. An act of murder is wrong, on this view, not because of what it is, but because of what it produces (if indeed it produces an overall negative effect.) The Deontologist disagrees. They claim that the morality of an act is intrinsic to it. Murder is wrong not because of what it produces or who it came from, but because of what kind of thing it is.</p>

<p>The word <em>deontology</em> comes from the Greek meaning the study of obligations or duties. The Deontologist is more concerned with duties and rights. We might consider the Ten Commandments as an instance of a deontological view. The requirement to respect your elders is absolute. You are told to respect them not because of the effects of doing so. You must respect them regardless of the kind of people they are or what that impact respecting them might have on you and others.</p>

<p>The main task for the deontologists is to decide on our duties and responsibilities. Is respecting our elders really a duty? How about never breaking a promise? Here deontologists give different theories about the source of our duties. Our focus will be the most famous deontologist,Immanuel Kant. Kant makes the following claim:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Right actions</strong></dt>
  <dd>Actions that are right in themselves because they are consistent with universal moral rules derived from reason.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="categorical-imperatives">Categorical Imperatives</h2>

<p>Kant introduced the notion of <em>categorial imperatives</em> to explain the absolute nature of moral duties. They contrast with <em>hypothetical imperatives</em> which tell you to do so something only if a certain event occurs, or condition obtains, e.g., donâ€™t eat too much sugar if you have diabetes. This tells us that we shouldnâ€™t eat sugar, but only if we have diabetes. Categorical imperatives are not conditional. They are absolute. Kant identified a number of imperatives, two of which are as follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.</li>
  <li>Act to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of another, as an end and never merely as a means.</li>
</ol>

<p>Kantâ€™s first categorical imperative asks us to generalize from any specific act and ask whether we can coherently conceive of a law that requires or prohibits  everyone to commit that act. If we cannot do so, then that shows us the act is moral/immoral. For instance, if you tell a lie for financial gain, you are acting according to a maxim like â€˜it is ok to lieâ€™. Can we will that this law becomes a universal law applicable to everyone, i.e., everyone could consistently lie? No! Lying is possible only if we assume that telling the truth is the norm, i.e., I can only trick you into thinking Iâ€™m telling the truth if it would, well, be a trick.</p>

<p>Kantâ€™s second imperative assumes that persons are ends in themselves. They are a source of duties and obligations. Kant claims that the reason persons are ends in themselves lies in their nature as autonomous, rational beings capable of directing their own lives, determining their own ends, and decreeing their own rules by which to live.</p>

<p>This second imperative tells us not to treat such people merely as means. We treat people as means if we ignore what makes them persons. For instance, if we coerce them, lie to them, undermine their rational decision making features, discriminate against them, then we are not treating them as rational autonomous creatures, creatures capable of making their own choices.</p>

<p>Two important notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kant does not claim that you can never use people as a means. He claims that you cannot use them merely as a means. Contrast two cases. In the first, a corrupt individual kidnaps Sam and forces him to clean his home. In the second, Sam advertises his home cleaning business and is contracted by a family to clean their house for them. In both cases, Sam is being treated as a means. But in the first, he is being treated as only a means. In the second case, Sam has entered freely into a contract to lend his service. He has not been coerced or tricked. So in this second case, he is also being treated as an end as well as a mean.</li>
  <li>The imperative requires that you treat humanity, wherever you find it, as an end and not merely as a means.  This generates duties to self, i.e., since you are human, you must treat yourself as an end and not merely as a means. This means, for instance, it is immoral to lie to yourself, it is immoral to undermine your ability to make decisions, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider now how the Consequentialist and Deontologist would disagree on some specific concrete scenario. There was recently a terrible Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Suppose, Sarah, a doctor returns from treating the ill in West Africa and sneezes as she enters the airport. The authorities panic. Might she be bringing the deadly virus home with her? Sarah, a doctor, says that there is no need for her to be quarantined. She will return home and monitor her situation. The authorities are unsure. They consider forcefully quarantining her. Would it be moral to do so? Here the Consequentialist will claim we must focus on the effects of quarantining her vs. not quarantining her. Which would lead to a greater balance of well-being over suffering? It might be that quarantining her against her will would have the best result, so the Consequentialist would say that doing so is the moral thing to do. In contrast, the Deontologist will claim that it is never moral to coerce someone. If we do so, we are not treating them as an autonomous agent, capable of making their own decisions. As such, we are violating the second categorical imperative and committing an immoral act.</p>
