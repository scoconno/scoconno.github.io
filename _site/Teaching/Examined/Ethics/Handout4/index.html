      <h2 id="virtue-ethics">Virtue Ethics</h2>

<p><img src="/Teaching/Examined/Ethics/Slide1.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The first two theories we have discussed are action orientated. Each agrees that the morality of an action in no way depends on the character of the person it. On these views, being a good person is irrelevant to the morality of your action. Virtue ethics is a radically different view:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Virtue Ethics</dt>
  <dd>An action is permissible only if a virtuous person would perform it. An action is impermissible only if a virtuous person would never perform it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Virtue Ethics traces its roots to the Ancient Greeks. Recall from the introduction to this course that, for Socrates, the most important goal in this life is to live a good life, to be a perfect a person. This, we recall, was a dominant view among the Greeks. They cared about living the best possible life, emulating their heroes, being recorded in the annals of history, etc. Moral deliberation for the Greeks focused less on what actions to perform and more on what kind of person to become. This is a very different approach to ethics. It places constraints on what kind of personality to develop. As such, the view can be more demanding than the other two considered. It may take extensive therapy, physical and mental training, as well extensive education to become a good person.</p>

<p>Personalities are comprised of clusters of character traits. Virtue Ethicists claim that a good person is one who has the best character traits, which they call <strong>virtues</strong>. A bad person, on the other hand, has the worse character traits, which are called <strong>vices</strong>. According to the Virtue Ethicists, we must develop the virtues and stamp out the vices. I’ll first focus generally on character traits and explain their relation to action. I’ll then discuss how the Virtue Ethicist selects some traits as virtues, others as vices.</p>

<h2 id="character-traits">Character Traits</h2>

<p>Character traits are multi track dispositions to think, feel, and act in certain ways. There are many such traits. Let us consider honesty as an illustration.</p>

<p>What does it mean to call someone ‘honest’? On the one hand, it says something about the way we expect the person <strong>to act</strong> in a variety of different scenarios. If we were to offer an honest person a chance to cheat on an exam, they will, of course, decline. If we ask an honest person whether they studied for their exam, they will tell the truth. If an honest person sees someone dropping a large sum of money, we expect them to return it and not keep it.</p>

<p>By calling a person honest, we also are saying something how we expect that person <strong>to feel</strong>. That is, there are a variety of emotions that we expect an honest person to experience in certain scenarios. If they watch a movie in which a person wins by deceit, they will feel anger.  They will feel sadness when watching an honest character fail in their endeavors. We also can imagine that an honest person would feel disgust if they were to witness cheating, pride if they saw their child tell a difficult truth, guilt if they slipped and told a lie.</p>

<p>We also expect honest people <strong>to think</strong> in certain ways. An honest person will think that, say, spying is not an admirable career; they certainly will not be drawn to a life where they constantly must lie. They may also have reservations about marketing and politics, but hold in high regard investigative journalism.</p>

<p>Notice that being honest involves much more than merely acting honestly. The idea here is that one has a trait, a disposition, from which honest actions, emotions, and thoughts will flow. Just acting honest will never make you honest. But being an honest person will lead you to act honestly.</p>

<h2 id="virtues-and-vices">Virtues and Vices</h2>

<p>Virtue Ethicists claim that some traits are virtues, some are vices. What would make a trait one or the other? Perhaps the best known answer comes from Aristotle, a student of Plato. Aristotle, born 384, was Macedonian but moved to Athens to study with Plato. He ultimately established his own school, the Lyceum, and is one of the most influential, if not the most influential, philosopher of all time. Find an overview of Aristotle’s life and contributions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIW4W_DYX4">here.</a></p>

<p>According to Aristotle, the traits which are virtues are those that allow us to flourish as a human being. Some lives go well. Some lives go poorly. Whatever enables a life to go well we should pursue. Whatever prevents a life going well we should avoid. Obviously, then, we need to try determine what it is for a life to go well, that is, what it is for a person to flourish as a human being.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s first move is to claim that x flourishes by realizing its function. Consider a knife. A knife’s job is to cut. A knife <em>flourishes</em> if it cuts well. It fails to flourish if it cuts poorly. What characteristic must a knife have to cut well? Obviously, sharpness. A blunt knife doesn’t cut well. A sharp knife does. According to Aristotle, then, sharpness is the virtue of a knife. It is what allows the knife to perform its function well, i.e., it it is what allows the knife to flourish.</p>

<p>Just as cutting is the activity characteristic of knives, Aristotle thinks human flourishing consists in our characteristic activity, the activity that humans and nothing else can engage in. According to Aristotle, that activity is reasoning. Only we seem capable of deliberating on what kind of life to live and how to figure out how to live that life. Since virtues are what allow a thing to perform its function well, a human’s virtue will be what it allows humans to reason well.</p>

<p>There is much to be said about what allows a human to reason well. Aristotle offers a rich moral psychology that distinguishes, on the one hand, those features a person must have if they are to follow the dictates of their reason, and, on the other hand, those virtues that will allow a person deliberate well.</p>

<p>For our purposes, we can ignore the complexities and focus on the kernel of the view by way of illustration. If, say, we intend to pursue the best career for ourselves, we will need to do two different things. First, we’ll need to form a judgement about the correct career, a judgement that arises from deliberating on relevant things and not from prejudices, odd desires, etc. If we are to act on that judgement, our motives and desires better be in accord with that judgement. If, for instance, you rationally decide that a music career is the one for you, your desires and motivation better be in agreement with that decision, e.g., you must be able to practice several hours a day, you must be undistracted by pleasures, obstacles, and alternatives that will arise as you practice.</p>

<p>The virtues, according to Aristotle, will be those character traits that that allow us reason well and those that ensure we are able to obey the dictates of our reasons. Our moral obligation, then, consists in promoting and preserving these traits while constantly guarding against anything which undermines them.</p>
