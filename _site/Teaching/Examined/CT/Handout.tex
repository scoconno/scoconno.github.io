\subsection{Work Sheet}\label{work-sheet}

If you haven't read Ch.1.3 of the textbook, stop. Please read that first
before turning to this handout, which is a summary/supplement to the
textbook. You will find some \textbf{self-assessment} exercises below.
The answer key is on the website.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Don't be fooled by every day uses of the words `philosophy',
`philosophical', and `philosopher'. Being philosophical is not the same
as merely stating your belief about some deep issue. Philosophy is first
and foremost a rule governed tool for rationally forming and assessing
the reasons for beliefs. Philosophers have little patience for those who
just state their views on some issue. They care about \textbf{the
reasons} for accepting such views. These reasons come in the form of
\textbf{arguments} which prove those views true or false. So, don't
expect us philosophers merely to respect your opinion. We will respect
your good arguments and will expect you to provide them.

Philosophy, then, is concerned with with critical thinking, which we
will define as follow:

\textbf{Critical Thinking:} The systematic evaluation or formulation of
beliefs, or statements by rational standards.

Critical thinking is systematic because it involves distinct methods or
procedures. We'll be learning some of those methods in this course. It
concerns evaluation because it concerns itself with assessing existing
beliefs, either your own or others. And it concerns formulation because
it helps you devise new beliefs. Finally, critical thinking assess
beliefs by particular standard, namely, by how well that belief is
supported by reasons. This contrasts to evaluating beliefs based on how
beautiful, or psychologically comforting they might be.

Philosophy, then, is concerned with arguments. You will encounter
arguments in two ways. First, you will be learning how to assess the
arguments of others. Such arguments are normally intended to convince
you to believe something. If someone argues that, say, corporation tax
should be raised, they want you, the listener, to agree with them and
form the same belief. You need some tool to decide whether to do that,
and that's how learning to assess arguments helps. It gives you the
ability to determine whether the reason someone has given for raising
corporation tax supports that conclusion, and so helps you determine
whether you should accept their proposal.

Second, you will be learning how to construct your own good arguments.
If you want me or anyone else to accept any of your beliefs, say about
taxation or religion or music, you need to provide me reasons for
thinking your belief is true. You do that by providing me good arguments
for that belief.

Since philosophy is concerned with good arguments, you need to learn
what arguments are and when an argument is a good one. The branch of
philosophy that concerns itself with these questions is called logic.
You could dedicate your life to the study of logic, but, for our
purposes, we only need a brief introduction to it. This handout proceeds
in four rough parts: 1) the elements of an argument are introduced, 2)
arguments are distinguished from non-arguments, 3) the difference
between deductive and inductive arguments is introduced, and 4) the
criteria for distinguishing good from bad arguments (first deductive,
then inductive) are outlined. I encourage you to read a section or two.
Try the self-assessment exercises and check the answer key to make sure
you understood the material.

\subsection{Arguments}\label{arguments}

What is an argument? An \textbf{argument} is a group of statements in
which some of them (\textbf{the premises}) are intended to support
another of them (\textbf{the conclusion}). They will standardly be
presented in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  P1: All humans are mortal.
\item
  P2: Socrates is human.
\item
  C: Socrates is mortal.
\end{itemize}

P1 and P2 are the premises of the argument. C is the conclusion. Not
every argument has two premises. In principle, there are arguments with
indefinitely many premises. For our purposes, we'll be focusing on
relatively short arguments. Let us look a little closer at the elements
of an argument.

\subsection{Statements}\label{statements}

Your beliefs and the reasons that support them are expressed by
statements. Think of the conclusion of an argument as the statement
which expresses the belief you or someone else holds. Think of the
premises as statements which express the reasons that support those
beliefs. If we are to properly state our beliefs and identify the
reasons for them, we need a grasp of \textbf{statements.} A statement is
an assertion that something is or is not the case. Statements are either
true or false. Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A triangle has three sides.
\item
  I see blue spots before my eyes.
\item
  7+5=12
\item
  There are black holes in space.
\end{itemize}

Not all sentences express statements, i.e., not all sentences express
claims that are true or false. The following are \textbf{not}
statements:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Does a triangle have three sides?
\item
  Stop telling lies.
\item
  Hey, dude.
\item
  Yay for Hilary!
\end{itemize}

Since reasons must be expressed by statements, a non-statement can never
serve as a reason for a belief, a premise in an argument. Consider the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Yay for Hilary!
\item
  Hilary will make the best President.
\end{enumerate}

Suppose that 2 expresses someone's sincerest belief. You know now that
1, since it is not a statement, could never be used to support that
belief.

\subsubsection{Exercise 1:}\label{exercise-1}

Which of the following sentences are statements?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You are not a liar.
\item
  Is God all-powerful?
\item
  Turn that music off.
\item
  You should never hit your mother with a shovel.
\item
  The best explanation for his behavior is that he was in a trance.
\item
  Rap music is better than punk rock.
\item
  Great balls of fire!
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exercise 2:}\label{exercise-2}

List 4 sentences that are statements. List 4 sentences that are not
statements.

\subsection{Identifying arguments}\label{identifying-arguments}

You know now that an argument is a group of statements in which some of
them (\textbf{the premises}) are intended to support another of them
(\textbf{the conclusion}). One important skill you need to learn as a
philosopher is the ability to identify which statement in an argument is
the conclusion and which are the premises. Try the exercises below
before checking the answer key.

\subsubsection{Exercise 3:}\label{exercise-3}

Identify and underline the conclusions and premises in the following
three arguments.

\begin{quote}
If Arme is in town, then she's staying at the Barbary Hotel. She's in
town. Therefore, she's staying at the Barbary Hotel
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Because banning assault rifles violates a constitutional right, the U.S.
government should not ban assault rifles.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Listen, any movie with clowns in it cannot be a good movie. Last night's
movie had at least a dozen clowns in it. Consequently it was awful.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Non-Arguments}\label{non-arguments}

Not every group of statements contains an argument. Another important
skill you will need to acquire is the ability to figure out when and
when a passage contains a genuine argument. Consider this example:

\begin{quote}
The cost of the new XJ fighter plane is \$650 million. The cost of three
AR21 fighter bombers is \$1.2 billion. The administration intends to
fund such projects.
\end{quote}

This passage contains three statements. But none of these statements is
clearly a conclusion that is being argued for. In other words, this
passage contains claims about the world, but it doesn't contain any
reasons (premises) for accepting those claims. Consider now this second
passage:

\begin{quote}
Alisha went to the bank to get a more recent bank statement of her
checking account. The teller told her that the balance was \$1725.
Alisha was stunned that it was so low. She called her brother to see if
he had been playing one of his twisted pranks. He wasn't. Finally, she
concluded that she had been a victim of bank fraud.
\end{quote}

You might read a passage like this in a novel or a newspaper article.
Don't be fooled by the apparently argumentative tone. It does not
contain any argument at all. To see this, notice that the author is not
trying to tell us why we too should accept that Alisha was the victim of
bank fraud. In other words, telling us that Alisha came to have a belief
is not the same as providing us reasons for thinking her belief is true.

\subsubsection{Exercise 4:}\label{exercise-4}

Which of the following passages contain an argument? In the passages
containing an argument, identify and underline the conclusions and
premises.

\begin{quote}
Attributing alcohol abuse by children too young to buy a drink to lack
of parental discipline, intense pressure to succeed, and affluence
incorrectly draws attention to proximate causes while ignoring the
ultimate cause: a culture that tolerates overt and covert marketing of
alcohol tobacco and sex to these easily manipulated, voracious
consumers. {[}Letter to the editor, New York Times{]}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The GAO says that any weapon that costs more than \$50 million apiece
will actually impair our military readiness. The cost of the new XJ
fighter plane is \$650 million dollars. The cost of three AR21 fighter
bombers is \$1.2 billion. We should never impair our readiness.
Therefore, the administration should cancel both these projects.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
I don't understand what is happening to this country. The citizens of
this country are trying to destroy the beliefs of our forefathers with
their liberal views. This country was founded on Christian beliefs. This
has been and I believe still is the greatest country in the world. But
the issue that we cannot have prayer in public places and on public
property because there has to be separation of church and state is a
farce. {[}Letter to the editor, Douglas County Sentinel{]}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Complex Passages}\label{complex-passages}

It is often difficult to identify the core argument in a complex
passage. You need to recognize which statements are parts of that
argument, but also which statements are not parts of that argument.
These other statements may serve some other role such as providing
important background information, or explaining a premise, or explaining
the consequences of accepting the conclusion, and so on. Try the
following exercise before checking the answer key:

\subsubsection{Exercise 5:}\label{exercise-5}

In the following passages, identify those statements which are part of
the argument. Identify those which are. Also identify the conclusions
and premises.

\begin{quote}
{[}1{]} A. L. Jones used flawed reasoning in his letter yesterday
praising this newspaper's decision to publish announcements of same-sex
unions. {[}2{]} Mr.~Jones asserts that same-sex unions are a fact of
life and therefore should be acknowledged by the news media as a
legitimate variation on social partner ships. {[}3{]} But the news media
are not in the business of endorsing or validating lifestyles. {[}4{]}
They're supposed to report on lifestyles, not bless them. {[}5{]} In
addition, by validating same-sex unions or any other lifestyle, the
media abandon their objectivity and become political partisans-which
would destroy whatever respect people have for news outlets. {[}6{]} All
of this shows that the news media-including this newspaper-should never
(explicitly or implicitly) endorse lifestyles by announcing those
lifestyles to the world.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
{[}1{]} You have already said that you love me and that you can't
imagine spending the rest of your life without me. {[}2{]} Once, you
even tried to propose to me. {[}3{]} And now you claim that you need
time to think about whether we should be married. {[}4{]} Well,
everything that you've told me regarding our relationship has been a
lie. {[}5{]} In some of your letters to a friend you admitted that you
were misleading me. {[}6{]} You've been telling everyone that we are
just friends, not lovers. {[}7{]} And worst of all, you've been secretly
dating someone else. {[}8{]} Why are you doing this? {[}9{]} It's all
been a farce, and I'm outta here.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Evaluating Arguments}\label{evaluating-arguments}

A \textbf{good argument} has (1) solid logic (an appropriate connection
between the premises and conclusion), and (2) true premises.

A \textbf{bad argument} (1) fails to have solid logic (fails to have an
appropriate connection between the premises and conclusion), or (2) has
false premises, or (3) both.

What makes the connection appropriate will vary by the type of argument
under consideration. There are two main types of arguments, deductive
and inductive.

\subsection{Deductive Arguments}\label{deductive-arguments}

A \textbf{deductive argument} is an argument intended to give logically
conclusive support to its conclusion.

If a deductive argument has good logic, then the argument is
\textbf{valid}. An argument is valid when the following situation
obtains: if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.

Note that the premises do not need to be true for an argument to be
valid. Assessing an argument for validity asks us to
suppose/imagine/hypothesize that the premises are true (even if we know
they are false), and then determine whether the conclusion must also be
true given that supposition. Or, to put it differently, we want to know
if there is any possible way the premises could be true and the
conclusion false. If there is not, the argument is valid. If there is,
then the argument is invalid.

A deductive argument is \textbf{sound} when (a) the argument is valid,
and (b) the premises are true.

Note that a deductive argument can be valid without being sound.
However, it cannot be both sound and invalid.

\textbf{Examples of valid arguments:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  P1. It's wrong to take the life of an innocent person.
\item
  P2. Abortion takes the life of an innocent person.
\item
  C1. Therefore, abortion is wrong.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  P1. All dogs are from Mars.
\item
  P2. Rex is a dog.
\item
  C1. Therefore, Rex is from Mars.
\end{itemize}

This second argument is valid, but it is not sound because the first
premise is false. The first argument is trickier. It is valid, but there
is much debate as to whether the two premises are true. Some deny P1.
They claim that mistakingly taking the life of an innocent person is not
immoral. Others deny that the fetus is a person and so claim that
abortion does not involve taking the life of a person. The point is that
determining validity requires looking at the structure of what's given.
Determining soundness is a different matter. It often takes serious
research and argumentation to determine whether the premises of an
argument are true or false.

\subsubsection{Exercise 6:}\label{exercise-6}

For each argument, indicate whether it is valid and sound.

\begin{quote}
`Anyone who wins an Oscar is famous. Halle Berry won an Oscar. Hence,
Halle Berry is famous.'
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
`Bill Clinton must be dishonest. After all, he's a politician and hardly
any politicians are honest.'
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
`Tom Cruise the actor is famous. After all, every actor who has won an
Oscar is famous, but he's never won one.'
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
`Claire must live on the same street as Laura, since she lives on the
same street as Max and he and Laura live on the same street. And each of
them lives on only one street.'
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Exercise 7:}\label{exercise-7}

Construct two arguments that are (a) sound; (b) valid, but not sound;
(c) invalid.

\subsection{Inductive Arguments}\label{inductive-arguments}

\textbf{Inductive Arguments} are supposed to give probable support to
their conclusions, i.e., the premises are supposed to show that the
conclusion is probably true. This falls short of showing that the
conclusion is decisively true. An inductive argument is \textbf{strong}
if its premises show that the conclusion is probably true. An inductive
argument is \textbf{weak} if it fails to be strong.

\textbf{Examples:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  P1. 85\% of the students at NJCU are Democrats.
\item
  P2. Mickey Mouse is a student at NJCU
\item
  C1. Therefore, Mickey Mouse is probably a Democrat.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  P1. 10\% of the students at NJCU smoke marijuana regularly.
\item
  P2. Sally is a student at NJCU.
\item
  C1. Therefore, Sally probably smokes marijuana regularly.
\end{itemize}

The first argument is strong. If the premises are true, then the
conclusion is more likely to be true than not. The second argument is
weak. Just because a small portion of the student body smoke marijuana,
it does not follow that Sally is more likely than not to be a smoker.

\subsubsection{Exercise 8:}\label{exercise-8}

Construct 2 inductive arguments that are (a) strong, and (b) weak.

\end{document}
