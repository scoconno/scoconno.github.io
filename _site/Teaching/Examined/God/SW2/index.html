      <h2 id="short-essay-2">Short Essay 2</h2>

<h3 id="prompt">Prompt</h3>

<p>You are a religious leader concerned about the teaching of evolutionary biology in high schools. You think that only God could explain the existence of life. The local school board is accepting public submissions on the issue.</p>

<p>Write a short letter to the school board using the Design Argument (and no other argument) to argue that God exists, i.e., arguing that only the existence of God and not evolutionary biology can explain complexity in nature.</p>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your submission must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This assignment covers material contained in Ch.2.</li>
  <li>Note that this is a letter. Include all appropriate letter headings, salutations, etc.</li>
  <li>The members of the school board are not philosophers. Your job here is to explain a piece of complex philosophy to smart lay people. Use examples, simple vocabulary, etc.</li>
  <li>You are being assessed on how well you understand the Design Argument for God’s existence. Using any other argument in your letter will lose you points.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit your assignment as a word file.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="/Teaching/Grading/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>Please find links to writing resources <a href="/Teaching/Resources/">here</a></p>
