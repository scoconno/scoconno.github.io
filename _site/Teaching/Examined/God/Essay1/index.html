      <h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit your paper as a word file.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="/Teaching/Grading/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>Please find links to writing resources <a href="/Teaching/Resources/">here</a></p>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>1000–1200 words. Writing less than 1000 or more than 1200 words will lose you points.</p>

<h3 id="prompt">Prompt</h3>

<p>Some believe in the existence of an all loving, all powerful, all knowing God. Use the existence of evil to argue that such a being cannot exist. Outline one way a Theist might respond to your argument and then counter that response.</p>

<h3 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write this paper pretending to be an Atheist.</li>
  <li>This essay has three parts. The first asks you to use the Problem of Evil to disprove God’s existence. The second asks you to explain one way the Theist might respond and the third asks you to rebut that response.</li>
  <li>This is an academic paper. It must include a thesis statement, an introduction, conclusion, and proper citation. See the resources page for guidance on writing philosophy papers.</li>
  <li>Assume a hostile audience. You need to change the minds of the Theist. Be clear. Offer full, but concise explanations, etc.</li>
  <li>Coffee Test: I will spend no more than 15 minutes reading each paper. Write <em>clearly</em>!</li>
</ul>
