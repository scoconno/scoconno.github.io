<h2 id="the-problem-of-evil-1">The Problem of Evil</h2>

<p>‘The Problem of Evil’ is a title given to a particular argument against God’s existence. The argument points to an apparent inconsistency between the way the world actually is and the way world should be if God existed. It is important to understand the kind of argument strategy that you will be encountering. Suppose that you were in a windowless room and receive a text message that it was raining outside. This will generate an expectation: there should be water falling from the sky. If you walk outside and no water is falling from the sky, you will conclude that the text message erred, or perhaps someone was playing a prank on you. In a similar way, many have observed that if God exists, the God of the Abrahamic religions at least, then we expect the world to be a certain way. Namely, it is a world in which there is no evil. However, when we look around the world, there clearly is evil. Just as we can conclude that it is not raining if there is no water falling from the sky, so too we can conclude that God doesn’t exist if there is evil all around us.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<p>The three Abrahamic religions attribute to God the following qualities:</p>

<p>a. God is omniscient: God knows everything. He knows everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. He knows what you had for breakfast yesterday, he knows what is going through your mind as you read this sentence, he knows what you will do tomorrow and every day after that. 
3. God is omnipotent. God is all powerful. He <em>can</em> do anything that a person can do and so much more. There is nothing he cannot lift. There is nothing he cannot move. There is nothing he cannot stop.<br />
1. God is omni-benevolent: God is all good.</p>

<p>If God is all loving, he would not want anyone to suffer. Since he is all powerful, he could bring it about that nobody suffers. And since he is all knowing, he knows both that suffering exists and knows how to alleviate it. For instance, God knows about each person who is being physically abused as you read these notes, he has the power to stop it, and he wants to stop.</p>

<p>Here is the problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If God exists, then s/he is omni-benevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent (call this “onmni+”)</li>
  <li>If God is omni+, then evil does not exist.</li>
  <li>Evil exists.</li>
  <li>Therefore, God is not omni+ (from 2&amp;3)</li>
  <li>Therefore, God does not exist (from 1&amp;4)</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="solution-1">Solution 1</h5>

<p><strong>Whole/Part Solution</strong></p>

<p>i. Suppose a whole, w, has a property F. 
i. Suppose a property, p, of w has the property ~F. 
i. It’s possible that w’s being F depends on p being ~F.</p>

<p>Consider a novel. A novel being exciting might depend on it having a chapter that is not-exciting. Similarly, one might claim that a whole life that is good depends for its goodness on some part being not-good, i.e., involve suffering. Similarly, the universe being good might depend on some part of the universe being not-good. Note that this proposed solution claims that there are <em>Necessary Evils</em>, i.e., that the goodness of the world, of a life, etc., depends on the existence of some evil.</p>

<p><strong>Responses</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>God is all powerful. If he created everything, he also created all of the dependency relations that are contained in the world. For instance, if good health depends, in part, on consuming sufficient vitamins, then God is the one who made the world so that this dependency exists. But, if God is all powerful, he could have created us so that this dependency does not exist, i.e., he could have made our maintenance of good health independent of vitamin intake. Similarly, if God is all powerful, he could have created the world so that no dependency exists between good and evil, i.e., he could have created a world in which the goodness in a life does not depend on some part of that life being bad. If he is all good, then he would have made good without needing evil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This solution asserts  that there exists a possible situation in which a world in which goodness depends on evil. But the response says nothing of what this possibility might consist in. We need a theory of how a good life/universe might depend for its goodness on it having a bad part.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="solution-2">Solution 2</h4>

<p><strong>The Free Will Response</strong></p>

<p>Assumed: S does P freely only if it was within S’s power to not do P. For instance, I freely moved my hand only if it was in my power to do otherwise. If, then, Mike Tyson takes my arm and uses it to hit my brother, I did not freely hit my brother—it was not in my power to do otherwise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The best thing for humans is free will.</li>
  <li>Since God Omni+ (especially all-loving), he would give humans what is best for them.</li>
  <li>God created humans with free will (from 1 &amp; 2)</li>
  <li>Evil is either directly or indirectly caused by some person’s free will.</li>
  <li>Evil is compatible with God being omni+ (from 4 &amp; 5)</li>
</ol>

<p>4 needs some clarification. 4 claims that all suffering in the world is caused directly or indirectly by some human. The direct cases are easy. They include all those cases where one person directly harms another person emotionally, physically, or psychologically. Indirect cases are harder. They include instance where someone doesn’t intend to cause any suffering, but where they set in motion a chain of events that result in someone suffering. For example, you may freely choose to speed some morning to arrive in work in time. As you speed, you swerve to miss a deer on the road. You hit a car that hits a school bus. The school bus veers of the road and several children die. In this case, the suffering was caused by your free-will. Even though you never chose to hurt some children, the unexpected result of some other free choice was the pain and suffering.</p>

<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Not all suffering, specially the suffering caused by natural disasters, is caused by human action. No person, or group of people, caused Hurricane Katrina. Of course, climate change is caused by humans and so future natural disasters may be caused by humans free-will. But many past natural disasters were not caused by humans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of our poor free choices come from weakness of character, e.g., laziness, sloth, and so on. If God were all powerful, he could have created us with better characters that would lead us to make better free choices. In other words, he could have created us in a way where we freely choose better things. He could have made us smart enough to avoid tragic mistakes. Note that this objection concedes that free-will can explain some of the suffering in the world. The problem is that there is <em>so much</em> suffering in the world. The objection assumes that God could have made us with free-will and still found ways to minimize our mistakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God’s omniscience seems incompatible with free will. Suppose that being omniscient means knowing of every proposition whether it is true or false. If he knows that I will chose the hamburger over the hot-dog on Fri., then there’s a truth of the matter as to whether I will choose one over the other of the matter. But if there is a truth of the matter, I do not have the power to choose what my future will be. In other words, God’s being all knowing entails that our future is fixed and not in our control. If God’s omniscience is incompatible with us having free-will, then appeals to free-will cannot reconcile an omniscient God with evil; there cannot be free-will, evil, and an omniscient God at the same time.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
