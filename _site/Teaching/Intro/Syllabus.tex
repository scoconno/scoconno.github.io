\section{Course Description and Objectives}

Are you free? Why live? What should you do with your life? In this
course, we'll be asking some of these deep philosophical questions. We
will begin by examining two classic arguments for the existence of God
as well as concerns that God's existence is incompatible with the
existence of evil. Many respond to this concern by claiming that evil is
the product of our Godly given free will. But do we have free-will or
are all of our actions determined by preceding events? If we don't have
free will, can anyone be blamed or praised for their actions? In the
third unit of the course, we will ask what determines the moral
character of our actions. We will also ask whether living morally is the
same as living a full and meaningful life. In this final part of the
course, we will discuss the meaning of life, especially why some
philosophers have connected a meaningful life with God's existence.

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) read
philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv)
write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and
persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of several core
philosophical topics.
