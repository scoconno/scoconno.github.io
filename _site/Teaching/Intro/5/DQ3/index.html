<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>‘The Walking Dead’ is a piece of science fiction. It depicts a post-apocalyptic future where zombies run amok and a few survivors bandy together for mutual protection. Since fiction often provides such extreme cases, it can be useful to help us clarify the ethical theories that we are discussing this week. We can ask what the ethical thing would be to do in a variety of situations depicted in shows like the Walking Dead.</p>

<p>In the short clip I link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbn1wELZlB8">here</a>, Carol, one of the main characters, makes a difficult choice.

After unsuccessfully trying to help Lizzie, Carol feels forced to kill her after Lizzie decided to turn another girl into a zombie. Watch Lizzie’s breakdown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GitS306EyBQ">here.</a></p>

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>

<p>Write three short paragraphs evaluating Carol’s behavior. In the first paragraph, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Consequentialist. In the second, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Deontologist. In the third, evaluate her action from the perspective of a Virtue Ethicists.</p>

<h2 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h2>

<p>Evaluating her action with an ethical theory requires you to a) decide whether that theory would judge the action moral, immoral, or neither, and b) explain why the ethical theory would make that evaluation. In doing both, you will need to be as specific as possible.</p>

<p>Points for this assignment are distributed equally across the three paragraphs—a third of the points per paragraph. To receive full points for a paragraph, you must</p>
