      <h2>Discussion Question 1</h2>

<p>Please note that answers to these discussion questions will be shared with your peers after the due date. </p>

<p>You will find in this module a short video clip from a Star Trek episode, &#39;The Measure of a Man.&#39; In this episode, the characters are debating the status of an android, Data. Is Data a person? Or is he merely an automaton? Riker, the commander in the red outfit, argues that Data is not a person. In this discussion question, you will be analyzing that argument in some detail. </p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>This assignment should be completed after you have done the assigned reading, studied the notes, and tried the self-assessment exercises. </p></li>
<li><p>Submit your answer to the Discussion Board in Module 1 by 07/13/15 @ 1:00 pm.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt</h3>

<ol>
<li>Introduce yourself to me and your peers. Tell us what you are majoring in (or intend to major in) and also about why you decided to study philosophy. (This part of your submission is not graded.)<br></li>
<li>In 150 to 200 words, analyze Riker&#39;s argument. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>Analyzing an argument has several steps: </p>

<p>a. Identify the conclusion that Riker is arguing for. I&#39;ll give you this one---he is arguing that Data, the android, is not a person. 
b. Identify the premises in Riker&#39;s argument. What evidence does he provide for his claim?
c. Determine if the argument is valid. Can you imagine a situation in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false? If so, the conclusion does not follow from the premises---the argument is not valid. (If you don&#39;t know what validity is, you need to review the textbook and notes.) 
d. Discuss whether the premises are true or false. Give reasons for your answers. </p>
