      <h1>What is Philosophy?</h1>

<h2>The Examined Life</h2>

<p>&quot;Philosophy&quot; is a Greek word meaning love of wisdom. As a discipline, philosophy took its distinctive form in Athens, Greece about 2500 years ago with the activities of one great individual, Socrates. While Socrates didn&#39;t write anything, we know a lot about him primarily from dialogues written by Plato, one of his inspired students and the second of the great Greek philosophers. </p>

<p>Plato tells us that Socrates, like most Greeks, didn&#39;t think that living in itself was that important. What was important was living a good life. Their heroes like Achilles died young, but lived brightly. From an early age, Greeks cared about how to distinguish them in this life. Socrates was no different. He didn&#39;t want to merely live, he wanted to live well. But unlike his fellow Greeks, Socrates was unsure what it was to live a good life. Should he devote his life to pleasure, or to distinguishing himself on the battleground, or to gaining political power? </p>

<p>Socrates believed that knowledge, in paticular, knowledge of how to live the best possible life was the most important thing to seek for a human. If we are ignorant of how to live well, then we risk gravely damaging ourselves and missing out on living a fulfilling, flourishing life. For this reason, Socrates claimed that the unexamined life was not worth living. Unwilling to live his life based on a mistake, he sought out those who claimed expertise about the good life. Socrates spent his time quizzing these apparent experts, testing them to see whether they really did know what they claimed to know. The experts failed these tests. They were often  confused or unable to answer simple questions about the topics they claimed expertise in. For instance, they might claim to know which people were courageous, but yet be unable to clearly state what courage is. Asking them what they knew. Questioning the establishment is dangerous and Socates was ultimately executed for corrupting the youth of Athens, not believing in the Gods of the city, and inventing new God. </p>

<p>We might think of others who have had been persecuted for holding controversial views. It&#39;s not easy. In part, it&#39;s not easy because most of us don&#39;t want to entertain the possibility that we are radically mistaken in how to live our lives, how to organize our societies, and what we and the world we inhabit is really like. </p>

<p>One of Socrates&#39; greatest legacies was his claim that he himself had  no knowledge of the things he inquired into. This single claim has shaped the character of philosophy as a discipline. Philosophy is not a body of knowledge, a list of facts that one can learn. Philosophy is first and foremost an activity, a set of skills that will allow you identify your beliefs, identify those that are wanting, and inquire in a mature, humble way into the most important facets of human life. You will not find in your textbook a list of facts to learn. Just as learning Karate, or dancing, or chess playing involvings learning a skill, learning philosophy is learning a set of skills. </p>

<h2>The Allegory of the Cave</h2>

<p>Learning philosophy is not easy. Many shy away from examining their deep convinctions. For those who do not, the process is difficulty, but rewarding. The effects of this educaiton were famously described famously in &#39;The Republic&#39;, by Plato, in his famous <em>Allegory of the Cave</em>. You will find an animated version of that allegory <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h55X9LJTAg4">here</a>.</p>

<p>People in the cave look at shadows thinking they are real. They can&#39;t turn their heads and see what makes the shadow. Imagine a baby that only had seen holograms in their life. They would never think the holograms were anything but real and have no idea that they were representations of real things. That&#39;s the beliefs you have. You already have beliefs. You have beliefs about whether God does or doesn&#39;t exist. You have beliefs about what&#39;s moral, for isntance, whether it&#39;s morally permissible to cheat on your partner. You have beliefs about what counts as a life well lived and lifes that fall short of that. For instance, you already have a belief as to whether a life devoted to taking of drugs is a life well lived. </p>

<p>In the cave, people are honored and given prizes for the beliefs they have about the shadows. The person who picks out a shadow of a cat reliabley and can distinguish it from shadows of a dog might be honoroed for their great perceptual powers, thinking that this ability is good. In our lives too, we honor and reward people based on various beliefs. We award someone a nobel peace prize for work on this, or a price for their artwork, or a prize for their athleticism at the Olympics, all of this relies on the belief that art, athleticism, is valuable, is something that should be honored and priced. </p>

<p>In the cave, you don&#39;t know anything different. You think the shadow of the cat is the real cat. Why think there is anything else? Plato describes the process of being turned away from the shadow as being violent. It&#39;s not something that will happen by itslef. It requires some external force. It is something that will be resisted. Philosophy is that. It&#39;s the discipline that will force you to look harder at your beliefs. That&#39;s why it&#39;s uncomfortable. Most people dislike that feeling and resist with all they can being asked to re-evaluate all the things they value and the beliefs that guide their life. </p>

<p>If you do wake up, if you are dragged from the cave, then you will initially be blinded by the sun. As your eyes adjust you will begin to see the things which made the shadows. The real cat. Likewise, philosophy is not something you will just get. Like dancing or a martial art it takes a lot of practice. Initially, many find it difficult to see what exactly is being asked of them. it feels odd to be in the mindset of the philosopher, but it comes over time. </p>

<p>Finally, Plato describes the process of descending back into the cave and seeing the shadows. You will look at the awards and honors and see them as paltry. You&#39;ll try help others see the light, but will not like you (think here of Socrates being killed for asking Athenians). Here we&#39;re being asked to imagine what happens once you &#39;get&#39; philosopher. Once you have gone far enough, you&#39;ll no longer unreflectively live your life. You will no longer just accept as true the claims of your family and society. As a philosopher, you will require argumentation. You will see the prizes as less prizeworthy and instead see what&#39;s truly valuable. People may not like you.  </p>

<p>Getting out of the cave is initially dizzying. Philosophy is like that. It&#39;s challenging. We care about identifying beliefs and deciding reflectively whether to accept them. </p>

<p>Sp, philosophy is not a disciplined that teaches you the answers to various questions. It is the activity of waking up. It gives you the ability to look for those answers yourselves. In this way, it frees us from being controlled by beliefs that are not our own. </p>

<ul>
<li>there is a distinction between ignorance and knowledge. </li>
<li>Humans fall in the middle. </li>
<li>Ancients were interested in philosophy as a way of living. </li>
<li>Ignorance for the soul was bad. </li>
</ul>
