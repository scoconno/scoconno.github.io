      <h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>Watch this link. It&#39;s either on the Matrix or the Cave. </p>

<p>&quot;Philosophy&quot; is a Greek word, which means love of wisdom. Philosophy as a discipline took its distinctive form in Athen, Greece about 2500 years ago with the activities of one great individual, Socrates. Socrates didn&#39;t write anything. What we know of him comes from primarily from dialogues written by Plato, one of his inspired students and the second of the great philosophers. Socrates didn&#39;t teach at a university. The Greeks didn&#39;t think that life was the most important think. It&#39;s living a good life that was important. Their heroes like Achilles died young, but lived brightly. So, they cared how to distinguish them in this life.  He didn&#39;t lecture. Instead, he spent his days talking to the citizens of Athens trying to understand what those citizens claimed to know. For Socrates believed that knowledge, in paticular, knowledge of how to live the best possible life was the most important things to seek for a human. If we are ignorant of how to live well, then we risk gravely damaging ourselves and missing out on living a fulfilling, flourishing life. For this reason, Socrates claimed that the unexamined life was not worth living. </p>

<p>When Socrates was alive, there were many people who professed to know how to live the best life, to be teachers of virtue---which for the Greeks was that quality in a life that made it go well. These folk would peddle their wares, charging lots of money to teach the young how to live well. Socrates wanting to know too how to life the best life went to these folk. He quizzed them, trying to ensure that they really did know what they claimed to know. Many of the reports of Socrates&#39; consist in a discussions which show up the teachers, they end up being confused or unable to answer simple questions about the topics, they claimed, expertise, for instance, they might claim to know what virtue is and how to teach it, but yet be unable to clearly state what virtue is. Asking them what they knew. He was ultimately put to death for challenging the status quo. We might think of others who have had the courage to stand up and hold uncontroversial views. It&#39;s not easy. In part, it&#39;s not easy because most of us don&#39;t want to entertain the possibility that we are radically mistaken in how to live our lives, how to organize our societies.</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a distinction between ignorance and knowledge. </li>
<li>Humans fall in the middle. </li>
<li>Ancients were interested in philosophy as a way of living. </li>
<li>Ignorance for the soul was bad. </li>
</ul>

<p>Socrates himself claimed no knowledge himself. This is a huge heritage. Philosophy was not a body of knowledge; a list of facts that one can learn perhaps like there are a system of facts like that in biology. Philosophy is first and foremost an activity, a certain way of taking yourself from ignorance to knowledge. That&#39;s why one who has knowledge is God. Contemporary philosophy is no different. You will not find in your textbook a list of facts to learn. That&#39;s not the point. Just as Karate, or dancing, or chessplaying is an activity, philosophy is a kind of activity that you learn to engage in. You learn how to rationally inquire into your beliefs and seke out the answers. </p>

<p>Philosophy is not easy. It&#39;s not comfortable and it&#39;s something that many people shy away from because it requires examining some deep convinctions. The effect of philosophy was described famously in &#39;The Republic&#39;, by Plato, in his famous allegory of the Cave. You will find an animated version of that allegory in the learning module as well as a copy of the text. </p>

<p>People in the cave look at shadows thinking they are real. They can&#39;t turn their heads and see what makes the shadow. Imagine a baby that only had seen holograms in their life. They would never think the holograms were anything but real and have no idea that they were representations of real things. That&#39;s the beliefs you have. You already have beliefs. You have beliefs about whether God does or doesn&#39;t exist. You have beliefs about what&#39;s moral, for isntance, whether it&#39;s morally permissible to cheat on your partner. You have beliefs about what counts as a life well lived and lifes that fall short of that. For instance, you already have a belief as to whether a life devoted to taking of drugs is a life well lived. </p>

<p>In the cave, people are honored and given prizes for the beliefs they have about the shadows. The person who picks out a shadow of a cat reliabley and can distinguish it from shadows of a dog might be honoroed for their great perceptual powers, thinking that this ability is good. In our lives too, we honor and reward people based on various beliefs. We award someone a nobel peace prize for work on this, or a price for their artwork, or a prize for their athleticism at the Olympics, all of this relies on the belief that art, athleticism, is valuable, is something that should be honored and priced. </p>

<p>In the cave, you don&#39;t know anything different. You think the shadow of the cat is the real cat. Why think there is anything else? Plato describes the process of being turned away from the shadow as being violent. It&#39;s not something that will happen by itslef. It requires some external force. It is something that will be resisted. Philosophy is that. It&#39;s the discipline that will force you to look harder at your beliefs. That&#39;s why it&#39;s uncomfortable. Most people dislike that feeling and resist with all they can being asked to re-evaluate all the things they value and the beliefs that guide their life. </p>

<p>If you do wake up, if you are dragged from the cave, then you will initially be blinded by the sun. As your eyes adjust you will begin to see the things which made the shadows. The real cat. Likewise, philosophy is not something you will just get. Like dancing or a martial art it takes a lot of practice. Initially, many find it difficult to see what exactly is being asked of them. it feels odd to be in the mindset of the philosopher, but it comes over time. </p>

<p>Finally, Plato describes the process of descending back into the cave and seeing the shadows. You will look at the awards and honors and see them as paltry. You&#39;ll try help others see the light, but will not like you (think here of Socrates being killed for asking Athenians). Here we&#39;re being asked to imagine what happens once you &#39;get&#39; philosopher. Once you have gone far enough, you&#39;ll no longer unreflectively live your life. You will no longer just accept as true the claims of your family and society. As a philosopher, you will require argumentation. You will see the prizes as less prizeworthy and instead see what&#39;s truly valuable. People may not like you.  </p>

<p>Getting out of the cave is initially dizzying. Philosophy is like that. It&#39;s challenging. We care about identifying beliefs and deciding reflectively whether to accept them. </p>

<p>Sp, philosophy is not a disciplined that teaches you the answers to various questions. It is the activity of waking up. It gives you the ability to look for those answers yourselves. In this way, it frees us from being controlled by beliefs that are not our own. </p>
