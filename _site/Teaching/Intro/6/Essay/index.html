<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare these essays by yourself. Use only the textbook and handoutsâ€”it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking exam scripts for significant overlaps as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>This essay is due 08/20 @ 1:00pm through Blackboard.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Please submit the file as either a pdf or word file. A simple .rtf file will also suffice</p>

<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="\Teaching\Rubric\">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Please find links to writing resources <a href="\Teaching\Resources\">here</a></p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>Your essays must be between 800-1000 words long. Essays shorter than 800 words or longer than 1000 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>

<p>Why did Tolstoy initially think that death robbed human life of meaning? How did turning to religion change his mind? Were his reasons for turning to religion justified? Give reasons for your answer.</p>
