## Our goal

We need to determine if an argument like the one below is a good one. It's deductive. So, it's good if it is both valid and sound. Our focus at the moment is validity: 

	Bill: "God must exist." 
	Jill: "How do you know." 
	Bill: "Well if the Bible is accurate, then God exists." 
	Jill: "Why should I believe the Bible?" 
	Bill: "Well, if God exists, then it has got to be accurate!"



##Validity

An argument is valid just if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false and **all** of the premises to be true. 

##Invalidity 

An argument is invalid just if it is possible for the conclusion to be false and *all* of the premises to be true. 

##Truth Tables

Truth tables allow us determine if it is possible for the conclusion to be false and, at the same time, the premises to be true. 

Strategy: construct a large truth table with smaller truth tables as their parts. One part is a truth-table for the conclusion. There is also one truth-table for each of the premises. After constructing the large truth-table, we will see if any line has a false conclusion and true premises.  

## Example

	Bill: "God must exist." 
	Jill: "How do you know." 
	Bill: "Well if the Bible is accurate, then God exists." 
	Jill: "Why should I believe the Bible?" 
	Bill: "Well, if God exists, then it has got to be accurate!"


'P': God exists

'Q': The Bible is accurate

+ P1: If God exists, then the Bible is accurate. (p-->q)

+ P2: If the Bible is accurate, then God exists. (q-->p)

+ C: God exists.   (p)
