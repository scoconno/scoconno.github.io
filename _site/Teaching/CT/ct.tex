\subsection{The Hypochondriac}\label{the-hypochondriac}

If I have the flu, then I have a sore throat. I have a sore throat.
Therefore, I have the flu.

\subsection{An argument over finance}\label{an-argument-over-finance}

Stan: You gotta spend money to make money. Francine: But you didn't make
any money! Stan: So logically, I didn't spend any money!

\subsection{A Cruel Detective}\label{a-cruel-detective}

Having arrested a young man on suspicion of theft, Detective Ted
pressed:

\begin{quote}
``Look how much you are sweating. You're lying! If you're sweating this
much, you're definitely not telling the truth.''
\end{quote}

\subsection{A Cold Weather Argument}\label{a-cold-weather-argument}

It's negative five degrees in Washington, DC; a pretty rare occurrence.
Greg and his friend Alan are walking a few blocks to get to a movie
theater in their neighborhood near the capitol building. Alan complains
about how frigidly cold it is. Greg, who grew up in Minneapolis, laughs
at Alan and says:

\begin{quote}
If a person grows up in Minnesota, they're familiar with below zero
temperatures. You didn't grow up there, so you don't know what it's like
to be in that type of cold for more than just a day.'
\end{quote}

\subsection{NSA Surveillance}\label{nsa-surveillance}

A politician trying to calm our fears about surveillance:

\begin{quote}
If you are a criminal, you should fear surveillance. But you're not a
criminal. So you have no reason to fear surveillance.
\end{quote}

\subsection{A Religious Example}\label{a-religious-example}

Never has a book been subjected to such pitiless search for error as the
Holy Bible. Both reverent and agnostic critics have ploughed and
harrowed its passages; but through it all God's word has stood
supreme\ldots{}. This is proof\ldots{}that here we have a revelation
from God; for\ldots{}if God reveals himself to man\ldots{}, he will
preserve a record of that revelation in order that men who follow may
know his way and will.

\subsection{Presidential Nominee:
Huckabee}\label{presidential-nominee-huckabee}

Mr.~Huckabee, for his part, responded with trademark humor. ``The Air
Force has a saying that says if you're not catching flak, you're not
over the target,'' he said. ``I'm catching the flak; I must be over the
target.''

\subsection{Birther Example}\label{birther-example}

Senate Resolution 511 on John McCain concerned his eligibility to run
for President. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff testified
before the Senate Judiciary Committee (on the subject of McCain's
eligibility) and made this statement:

\begin{quote}
My assumption and my understanding is that if you are born of American
parents, you are naturally a natural-born American citizen.
\end{quote}

He subsequently concluded that McCain was not a natural born citizen.
