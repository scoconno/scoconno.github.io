      <h2 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h2>

<p>Essays are graded according to a rubric that can be found <a href="rubric.pdf">here.</a> Below is a brief description of the various grading categories.</p>

<p><strong>Grasp of the Material:</strong> A very good essay has the following characteristics: 1) it explains the material, and only the material, that is required to address the prompt, 2) it contains no confusions, 3) it contains no errors in the explanation of a theory, 4) it contains no factual errors concerning the philosophers in question.</p>

<p><strong>Logic Tools:</strong> A very good essay clearly and identifies the arguments being discussed, contains a clear identification of the relevant conclusions and premises of the arguments being discussed, contains an appropriate use of the concepts of validity, soundness, weakness, and cogency. In addition, a very good essay contains a clear explanation and assessment of both the logic of any argument discussed as well as the truth of the premises contained in those arguments. Points are lost for logical confusions.</p>

<p><strong>Original Thought:</strong> A very good essays presents the material in ways that go well beyond the textbook, sundry reading, and notes. It does so by either using original examples, or presenting material in new and interesting ways, or containing some new, but relevant, remarks concerning the logic of an argument or the truth of its premises. Few essays contain this last characteristic. Students are encouraged to demonstrate original thought either through one or both of the first two ways mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong>  I will examine whether you have read, understood, and can deploy the lessons of the writing resources linked to in <a href="\Teaching\Resources\">Resources</a>. I will be assessing a) how well you organize your whole paper—why you make the points you do, and why you present them in the order that you do—, b) how well you organize and write each individual paragraph—each paragraph should contain one distinct point with the other sentences clearly relating to that point, and c) how well you write each sentence, and d) how well you incorporate and cite any material that you have used in preparing your essay.</p>
