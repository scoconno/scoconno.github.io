<h3 id="premise-1---the-divisibility-of-space">Premise 1 - the divisibility of space</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If x is infinitely divisible, x can be divided into ever smaller
parts <em>ad infinitum</em>. In other words, x contains no indivisible
parts, i.e. parts that cannot further be divided.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>For example, suppose that a line, L, is infinitely divisible.
Lines are divided into line segments. So every line segment of L
can be divided into further smaller line segments - there is no
smallest line segment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Think of this process of dividing something out as
merely conceptual. Don’t worry whether or not we could literally
do something to x to divide it in this way.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If x is not infinitely divisible, x can be divided into a finite
number of <em>smallest</em> parts, i.e. parts that cannot be divided into
any smaller parts.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For example, suppose that a line, L, is not
infinitely divisible. Then L contains a finite number of
smallest line segments, i.e., line segments with some smallest
extent that cannot be divided into any further line segments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="premise-3">Premise 3</h3>

<p>This handout will proceed by discussing Premise 3. See Handout 1 for
discussion of Premise 2. Zeno offers two distinct arguments for Premise
3 that again come in the form of paradoxes. The strategy for each is
similar. We will fist assume that space is not infinitely divisible,
then prove that certain absurdities follow. If an assumption leads to an
absurdity, we know the assumption is false.</p>

<h3 id="stadium-paradox">Stadium Paradox</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fourth argument is that concerning equal bodies which move
alongside equal bodies in the stadium from opposite directions—the
ones from the end of the stadium, the others from the middle—at equal
speeds, in which he thinks it follows that half the time is equal to
its double…. (Aristotle Physics, 239b33)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suppose these rows of blocks represent some chariots in a stadium. The
B’s are stationary. The A’s are moving from left to right. The last
block in that row is called D. The Cs are moving towards from right to
left. The middle block in that row is called E.</p>

<p>[c]<span>@lll@</span> &amp; T1 &amp;&amp; DAA &amp; –&gt;&amp; BBB &amp;&lt;– &amp; CEC &amp;</p>

<p>[c]<span>@rll@</span> &amp; T3 &amp;–&gt; &amp;   DA &amp; A&amp; BBB &amp;    C &amp; EC  &amp; &lt;–</p>

<p>Compare Times 1 and 3. Suppose they are separated by a one minute
interval. In this interval, D has passed one B block and two C blocks.
Zeno thinks this is paradoxical. It’s unclear why. For our purposes, let
us assume the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is smallest possible length, <em>S</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The length of each block is S.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no gaps between the blocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The blocks move with constant velocity.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It took 1 minute for D to pass two C blocks. It should take 30 seconds
to pass one C block and become level with E. Suppose D passes one C
block after 30 seconds. How many B blocks has it passed? Try filling out
the diagram below to answer that question.</p>

<p>[c]<span>@rll@</span> &amp; T2 &amp;–&gt; &amp; DAA &amp;&amp; ? &amp;    C &amp; EC  &amp; &lt;–</p>

<p>T3 This describes the moment that D and E are level. How does D relate
to the B’s at this moment?</p>

<p>We are stuck! Suppose that someone claims that D has passed <em>half of one
B block.</em> Let this half be called <em>H</em>. What is H’s length? You cannot,
on pain of contradiction, claim that H has a length less than S. We have
assumed that S is the smallest possible length, so H cannot be shorter
than S.</p>

<p>This way of stating the paradox assumes that the length of time between
T1 and T3 can be divided in two, i.e., 1 minute is divided into two 30
second intervals. Suppose that time is also atomic, that there is a
smallest interval of time, a single quantum of time. Suppose also that
the motion between T1 and T3 takes a single quantum of time. If this is
correct, there is no T2 (which was half the interval between T1 and T3.)</p>

<p>Paradox still threatens. During a single quantum of time, D and E will
have passed each other (as is seen in T3), but there is no moment at
which they are level as is described in T2: since T1 &amp; T3 are separated
by the smallest possible time, there can be no instant between them—it
would be a time smaller than the smallest time from the two moments we
considered. Conversely, if one insisted that if they pass then there
must be a moment when they are level, then it shows that cannot be a
shortest finite interval.</p>

<h3 id="the-arrow-paradox">The Arrow Paradox</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The third is … that the flying arrow is at rest, which result follows
from the assumption that time is composed of moments … . he says that
if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that
which is in locomotion is always in a now, the flying arrow is
therefore motionless. (Aristotle Physics, 239b.30)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zeno abolishes motion, saying “What is in motion moves neither in the
place it is nor in one in which it is not”. (Diogenes Laertius Lives
of Famous Philosophers, ix.72)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="outline-of-the-paradox">Outline of the Paradox</h3>

<p>Assume the following claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Space is finitely divisible.</li>
  <li>Time is composed of moment.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>P1. An arrow must occupy a space equal to itself at each moment that it exists.</li>
  <li>P2. If an arrow moves for, say, 1 minute, the arrow will occupy a space equal to itself at each moment that is it moving.</li>
  <li>P3. An arrow that occupies a space equal to itself at a specific moment is not moving in that moment in that space.</li>
  <li>P4. If an arrow is not moving</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider an arrow, apparently in motion, at any instant. First, Zeno assumes that it travels no distance during that moment—‘it occupies an equal space’ for the whole instant. But the entire period of its motion contains only instants, all of which contain an arrow at rest, and so, Zeno concludes, the arrow cannot be moving.</p>

<p>” a moving arrow must occupy a space equal to itself during any moment. That is, during any moment it is at the place where it is. But places do not move. So, if in each moment, the arrow is occupying a space equal to itself, then the arrow is not moving in that moment because it has no time in which to move; it is simply there at the place. The same holds for any other moment during the so-called “flight” of the arrow. So, the arrow is never moving. Similarly, nothing else moves. The source for Zeno’s argument is Aristotle (Physics, Book VI, chapter 5, 239b5-32).</p>

<h3 id="the-standard-solution">The Standard Solution</h3>

<p>The standard solution to the paradox uses the “at-at” theory of motion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) being in motion involve being at different places at different times, and (ii) being at rest involves being motionless at a particular point at a particular time.</li>
</ul>

<p>This theory asks us to distinguish two things:</p>

<p>a) being in motion in or during an instant. 
b) being in motion at an instant.</p>

<p>The at-at theory accepts that the arrow cannot move during an instant, but claims that the arrow can still move at an instant. It does so by occupying different locations before and after that instant.</p>

<p>If this is correct, the difference between rest and motion has to do with what is happening at nearby moments and has nothing to do with what is happening during a moment. The arrow counts as moving at an instant because it occupies different locations before and after that instant. The arrow counts as being at rest at an instant because it is not located at different locations before and after that instant.</p>

<p>The instant must be part of a period in which the arrow is continuously in motion.</p>

<p>instantaneous motion from instantaneous rest.</p>

<p>The Arrow Paradox seems especially strong to someone who would say that motion is an intrinsic property of an instant, being some propensity or disposition to be elsewhere.</p>

<p>Calculus: speed of an object at an instant (instantaneous velocity) is the time derivative of the object’s position.</p>

<p>This means the object’s speed is the limit of its speeds during arbitrarily small intervals of time containing the instant.</p>

<p>The object’s speed is the limit of its speed over an interval as the length of the interval tends to zero.</p>

<p>The derivative of position x with respect to time t, namely dx/dt, is the arrow’s speed, and it has non-zero values at specific places at specific instants during the flight.</p>

<p>The speed during an instant or in an instant, which is what Zeno is calling for, would be 0/0 and so be undefined.</p>

<p>Using these modern concepts, Zeno cannot successfully argue that at each moment the arrow is at rest or that the speed of the arrow is zero at every instant. Therefore, advocates of the Standard Solution conclude that Zeno’s Arrow Paradox has a false, but crucial, assumption and so is unsound.</p>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<p>Stuff before and a moment determines if its moving. That’s odd.</p>

<p>Suppose God were to wipe the arrow out of existence completely an instant after it moved. This would mean that it was not moving. But notice here that we are assuming that the future is fine in the future.</p>
