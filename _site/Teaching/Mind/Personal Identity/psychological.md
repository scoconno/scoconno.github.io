## Psychological Continuity



Recap
=====

What does personal identity consist in?\
Three Options

Same Body Theory: A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a
later time iff the body of A is identical to the body of B.

Same Soul Theory: A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a
later time iff the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.

Psychological Continuity Theory: A person A at one time is identical to
a person B at a later time iff B is psychologically continuous with A.

Version 1
=========

Memory Continuity

A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time iff B
*remembers* the *experiences* that A has.

Memory

Factual Memories: Memories that a particular event occurred. They can be
shared by several people, e.g., many of us remember President Obama’s
inauguration.

Personal Memories:

Memories of having the experience of an event. They cannot be shared,
e.g., only President Obama has the memory of *being inaugurated* at his
inauguration.

Objection

-   Allow ‘Rike’ to be the 7 year old who will grow up to be Riker.

    -   Riker = Rike only if Riker remembers everything that Rike
        experenced.

    -   Riker does not remember what Rike ate for breakfast on the
        second day after his 7th birthday, though Rike certainly had the
        experience of eating something

    -   Riker $\neq$ Rike

Version 2
=========

Psychological Continuity-Version 2

A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time iff B
is psychologically continuous with A.

Psychological Continuity: There is a chain of person-stages connected by
episodic memory.

![image](letters.jpg)

-   F remembers what E experienced.

-   E remembers what D experienced.

-   D remembers what C experienced.

-   C remembers what B experienced.

-   B remembers what A experienced.

-   Thus, A, B, C, D, E, and F are psychologically continuous with each
    other.

-   Hence, they are all stages of the one very same person.

Problem: Apparent vs Real Memory ![image](fake.jpg)

I really remember X iff

-   I have an experience as though I remember experiencing X.

-   I did experience X.

I apparently remember X iff

-   I have an experience as though I remember experiencing X.

-   I did not experience X.

Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 1

Internal Differences

-   If I could perceive a qualitative difference between a real and an
    apparent memory of X, then this qualitative difference would
    distinguish the real and apparent memory of X.

-   I can perceive no qualitative difference between a real and an
    apparent memory of X.

-   No qualitative difference distinguishes real and apparent memories
    of X.

Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 2

Suggestion: If two persons A and B both have an experience as though
they remember the experiences of some person P, then the memory of A (or
B) is real and not apparent only if A (or B) is identical to P.

The problems is that it is circular to make both claims:

1.  A = P only if A really remembers what P experiences.

2.  A really remembers what P experiences only if A = P.

Circular Reasoning

Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 3

Suggestion

-   A real memory is one that was caused in the right way.

-   An apparent memory is one that was not caused in the right way, e.g.
    hypnosis, implantation, etc.

Problem-Duplicates!

-   Two persons A and B both have memories of what P experienced that
    were caused in the right way.

-   A $\neq$ B.

-   Having memories caused in the right way is not sufficient for
    personal identity.
