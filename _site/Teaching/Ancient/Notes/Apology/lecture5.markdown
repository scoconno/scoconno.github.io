#### Basic structure of dialogue ####

17a–35d: S’s main defense; found guilty

35e–38b: S proposes as “punishment” that he be given free meals in the
Prytaneum; sentenced to death

38c–42a: S’s parting words

#### The Charge ####

Socrates is charged with two offenses:

1. Corrupting the young of Athens. 
2. Not believing in the Gods, but creating new Gods. 

#### Socrates' Defense ####

1. He thinks there is an implicit accusation, something about him not being liked. He defends himself by arguing that a) he has no knowledge and that somehow he makes people better by relieving them of their ignorance. He thinks this makes them better of. 


#### Socratic ignorance: specific claims ####

1. S does not know anything about “physics”/natural philosophy (19c)

2. S does not know how to make people “excellent” (= virtuous) (20c)

3. S has (if anything) “human wisdom” = does not think he knows what he does not know (20–21d)

Two Qualifications: 

* But: S grants the craftsmen know many things about their crafts (22d); how?

* These claims are typically stated with noun “*epistêmê*” and verb
“*epistasthai*”

#### What is human wisdom? ####

It seems clear that the scope of [3] covers “the most important
things”–seeming to mean moral or ethical truth; but, the meaning of his
denial is controversial:

-   S has no (ethical) knowledge *at all*; but, he does have
    (ethical) beliefs (if so, what does he take to be the status of  those beliefs?)</span>

-    S has no technical or expert (ethical) knowledge, but
    does have non-technical knowledge</span>

-    S lacks systematic (ethical)
    understanding but does have some piece-meal knowledge</span>

At 29b, Socrates claims, “To act unjustly, on the other hand, to disobey someone better than oneself, whether god or man, that I do know (*oida*) to be bad and shameful.”


#### The “Elenchus” (= “test,” “cross-examining,” “method of (dis)proof”) ####


X = alleged knower; P, Q, R, etc. = propositions

1. S finds a claim X asserts, P</span>

2.  <span>S gets X to assert other claims, Q, R, ...</span>

3.   <span>S gets X to conclude (from Q, R, ...), not-P</span>

4.   <span>S gets (or tries to get) X to conclude that he does not know    whether P</span>

This method shows, at the least, that X has an inconsistent belief set

What kind of knowledge [1], [2], or [3] would this test for?

#### “The” problem of the elenchus####

S seems to think that elenchus is *the* method of philosophical thought
*and* that philosophical thought is necessary for happiness, BUT

A consistent set of beliefs can still be false, so what would be the upshot even if someone “survived” the elenchus?

-   <span>How, despite this, could S think the elenchus can be employed
    to make progress?</span>

#### What matters in life, according to Socrates ####

The state of one’s soul (*psuchê*) is of the utmost importance (29e,
30b). Is it the *only* thing that matters? Or just the most important?

The translation of 30b3-5 is controversial:

> It’s not from wealth that virtue comes, but from virtue comes money,
and all the other things that are good for human beings, both in private
and in public life.” [Grube]

Alternative:

> It’s not from wealth that virtue comes, but from virtue money and all
the other things become good for human beings, both in private and in
public life.” [Alternative]

The fear of death should not lead people to act unjustly, impious, etc.

-   <span>Socrates paints two possible pictures of what death is like,
    neither of which he thinks we should fear (40c–41c)</span>

    -   <span>A dreamless sleep</span>

    -   <span>Existence in Hades with other deceased people</span>
