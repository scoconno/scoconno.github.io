  <li>
    <p><span>Ancient $\neq$ Dumb</span></p>

  <li>
    <p><span>Principle of Charity: If two interpretations are equally
consistent with the text, attribute the more philosophically
interesting view to the author.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span>Principle of Humility: Be humble in your approach to
these texts. If you have an interpretation that attributes an absurd
view to a thinker, you should suspect that you haven’t exactly
figured out what the view is. These views (like all views) can be
challenged, but must be challenged <em>respectfully</em>.</span></p>
