<p>You are a writer for a small publishing company. Your company specializes in educational material, particularly in short works aimed to explain difficult material to middle school children. You have received a difficult task today.’Nicomachean Ethics’ Book I has ended up on your desk. Your editor asks you to write a short piece on ch.5, on the choice of lives, for 21st century children. What a task! You will need to translate that difficult technical material into simple, English prose. And you have to do it in a way that youngsters will be able to read and understand it. A tough job. But you are up to the task! You will write biographies of three people pursuing these distinct lives to explain these three conceptions of happiness.</p>

<h2 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Work <strong>only on ch.5 of Book 1</strong>. It’s very short!</li>
  <li>Attend carefully to your audience. Your work will be read at middle-school! Use examples that students of that age might understand. Whatever you do, do not write this with your college professor or college peers as your intended audience.</li>
  <li>Normal rules for plagiarism apply. See the syllabus for details.</li>
  <li>Please write 250-500 words. No more. No less.</li>
  <li>Submit your responses by Mon. @ 1pm.</li>
