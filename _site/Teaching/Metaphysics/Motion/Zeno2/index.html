<h3 id="premise-1---the-divisibility-of-space">Premise 1 - the divisibility of space</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If x is infinitely divisible, x can be divided into ever smaller
parts <em>ad infinitum</em>. In other words, x contains no indivisible
parts, i.e. parts that cannot further be divided.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>For example, suppose that a line, L, is infinitely divisible.
Lines are divided into line segments. So every line segment of L
can be divided into further smaller line segments - there is no
smallest line segment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Think of this process of dividing something out as
merely conceptual. Don’t worry whether or not we could literally
do something to x to divide it in this way.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If x is not infinitely divisible, x can be divided into a finite
number of <em>smallest</em> parts, i.e. parts that cannot be divided into
any smaller parts.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For example, suppose that a line, L, is not
infinitely divisible. Then L contains a finite number of
smallest line segments, i.e., line segments with some smallest
extent that cannot be divided into any further line segments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="premise-3">Premise 3</h3>
<p>This handout will proceed by discussing Premise 3. See Handout 1 for discussion of Premise 2. Zeno offers two distinct arguments for Premise 3 that again come in the form of paradoxes.  The strategy for each is similar. We will fist assume that space is not infinitely divisible, then prove that certain absurdities follow. If an assumption leads to an absurdity, we know the absurdity false.</p>

<h3 id="stadium-paradox">Stadium Paradox</h3>

<p>The first paradox is the Moving Block Paradox. Also called the Stadium Paradox. :</p>

<p>A.  The distance between A and B is infinitely divisible (assumed).</p>

<p>B.  A journey from A to B is a series of sub-journeys with no last
    member:  from A to  $\frac{1}{2}AB$, from $\frac{1}{2}AB$ to
    $\frac{3}{4}AB$, and so on.</p>

<p>C.  It is impossible to complete a series of sub-journeys with no
    last member.</p>

<p>D.  Completing a journey from A to B, requires completing the series of sub-journeys with no last member:  from A to  $\frac{1}{2}AB$, from $\frac{1}{2}AB$ to $\frac{3}{4}AB$, and so on.</p>

<p>E. It is impossible to complete the journey from A to B.</p>

<p>The short writing assignment for this module will ask you to try solve this paradox, so I won’t offer any solutions in this handout.</p>

<h3 id="the-arrow-paradox">The Arrow Paradox</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Suppose that space is not infinitely divisible.</li>
  <li>If space is not infinitely divisible, then there is a finite number of smallest regions of spaces between two points, A and B.</li>
  <li>There is a finite number of smallest regions of space between A and B.</li>
  <li>If an arrow moves from A to B from t1 to tn, at some time between t1 to tn, it must occupy each region of space between A and B.</li>
  <li>If an arrow occupies a region of space at a time, then it is at rest in that moment in that region.</li>
  <li>An arrow at rest in different regions of space at different times, does not move.</li>
  <li>The arrow does not move.</li>
</ol>

<p>This argument is valid and straightforward. It relies on the intuitive notion that a whole, w, cannot have a property P, when it’s parts have some contradictory property, Q. If each part of the table is blue, the whole table cannot be red. Similarly, if the parts of the arrows flight are parts where the arrow is at rest, then the whole flight cannot be a motion.</p>

<p>, but some deny that it is not sound because C1 is false. They claim that it relies on the false assumption that completing an infinite series of tasks would take an infinite period of time. This seems false. As we divide the distances between the points we travel, we should also divide the time it takes to travel the ever smaller distances:</p>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<p>While the argument is valid, many will deny the claim that the arrow is at rest at each moment. Again, this is about calculus.[^1]</p>

<h3 id="objection">Objection</h3>

<p>On this response, motion at a time t1, depends on what is happening before and after t1. A main concern is that what’s happening in this moment cannot be dependent on what’s happening in the future. The future does not yet exist.</p>

<p>Let us imagine that an arrow is moving. Let us assume that God exists. Let us assume that God will annihilate all things and time immediately after t1. Well, it looks like the arrow was not moving at t1.</p>
