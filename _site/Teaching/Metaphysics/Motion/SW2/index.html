      <h2 id="hardcopies">HARDCOPIES!</h2>

<p>Due to a shoulder injury, I need to refrain from typing. Please submit this assignment to me as a hard-copy in class on October 12th.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the assigned readings and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submissions as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="/Teaching/Grading/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Please find links to writing resources <a href="/Teaching/Resources/">here</a></p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>Your submission must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>

<p>Zeno uses his Stadium Paradox to argue that motion is impossible in discrete space, i.e., a space in which there is a smallest spatial distance. Assume that space is discrete. This essay has two parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain the Stadium Paradox</li>
  <li>Try solve the paradox while maintaining the assumption that space is discrete.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Please use diagrams, illustrations, etc. to explain the paradox. They help!</li>
  <li>We didn’t discuss possible solutions in class. This was by design. The second part of this exercise is asking you to think for yourself. It’s ok if your solution ultimately won’t work. I want you to try!</li>
  <li>Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. You will need to explain the terminology you introduce.</li>
</ul>
