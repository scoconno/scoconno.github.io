\section{Course Description and Objectives}

Most of us believe that change exists; that babies are born, that trees grow, and that planes fly in the sky. However, the existence of change has long been doubted by certain metaphysicians. Some deny that any kind of change exists. Other deny that certain kinds of change like motion exist. These denials seem radical; surely babies are born, trees do grow, and planes really do fly in the sky. Nevertheless, the arguments that change does not exist are powerful. Our goal in this course is to understand and assess these arguments. 


\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to (i) read
philosophical texts, (ii) clearly and charitably explain viewpoints that
are not their own, (iii) think critically and philosophically, (iv)
write well-structured prose in which they clearly state a thesis and
persuasively defend it, (v) demonstrate an understanding of several core
metaphysical issues.
