<h2 id="aristotle-background">Aristotle background</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Born in Stagira in Macedonia around 384 BCE</li>
  <li>Macedonia is far North of Greece</li>
  <li>Father was a physician at the Macedonian court.</li>
  <li>Moved to Athens at the age of 17 to study at Plato’s Academy in 367 BCE
    <ul>
      <li>470/69 BCE: Socrates is born in Athens</li>
      <li>428/27 BCE: Plato is born, studies with Socrates</li>
      <li>399 BCE: Socrates is executed for impiety and corrupting the
  youth of Athens</li>
      <li>387 BCE: Plato establishes the Academy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Athens was the cultural, political, and financial capital of the Mediterranean.
    <ul>
      <li>In the fifth and fourth centuries, during the lifetimes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, Athens was an independent state consisting of the urban area and the surrounding rural areas of Attica. (The total population is difficult to estimate. It may have had about 20,000 citizens; see below on the definition of ‘citizen’.) Other Greek cities were allies of or subordinate to Athens; the Athenian alliance was opposed to a roughly similar alliance of other Greek cities led by Sparta.</li>
      <li>Aristotle was not a citizen of Greece.</li>
      <li>Athens (like some other Greek cities, but by no means all) had a democratic constitution. The Greek ‘dêmokratia’ is derived from ‘kratos’ (power) and ‘dêmos’ (used both for ‘the people’ as a whole, and in a more specific sense for the lower classes); hence it indicates that power belonged to the people as a whole, rather than to a particular class. Greek democracy was significantly different from the representative system that we are used to calling ‘democracy’.  (The Greeks would have regarded the present US constitution as a form of ‘oligarchy’ – literally ‘rule by the few’.)  It involved ‘direct’ democracy, in so far as the most important decisions were taken by a mass meeting of all citizens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Was known as the “brain of the academy”. None of his writings from that time survive.</li>
  <li>347 BCE, Plato dies and Philip of Macedonia overthrows Athenian allies. Aristotle is not made head of the academy. He flees with other academics to Assos on the North Aegean Coast of Turkey. Persian war forces him to retreat to the island of lesbos. There he marries Pythias, the adoptive daugther of King Hermias. He begins his life long love of biology. One third of his writing is about Biology. Pythias was accomplished in her own right.</li>
  <li>Phillip II invites Aristotle back to Macedonia to tutor his son, Alexander. Alexander became the Alexander the Great. He conguered North Africa, middle East, Iran, really all of  west Asia, and all the way to North India. He was attempting to congquer the entire world. He was surprised to know that he wasn’t. Two upshots. 1) He spread Greek culture throughout, most importantly he spread the teachings of his beloved Aristotle. 2) He made available to Aristotle the largest empire known to man at that time. Aristotle intended to learn about every bird, pland, fish, mammmal, etc. He wanted a complete list. Alexander made available tens of thousands of soldiers. It would be like the marines being made available to you.</li>
  <li>334 BCE: Aristotle returns to Athens under the protection of Atipater who had been appointed by Alexander to rule Athens. Aristotle has a duaghter at this time named Pythia after his wife, but the wife dies. He marries another woman Herpyllis and has a son called Nicomachus.</li>
  <li>Aristotle opens his own school, Lyceum. next 11 years are his most productive.
    <ul>
      <li>Invented or discovered logic</li>
      <li>Wrote ‘Physics’ and we have that discipline.</li>
      <li>Wrote ‘Rhetoric’ and created that discipline</li>
      <li>Wrote ‘On Meteorology’ and new discipline.</li>
      <li>Advanced well beyond what in many ways what was to become natural science</li>
      <li>And, did a great deal on questions in what he calls “ethics”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>323 BCE: Alexander dies</li>
  <li>322 BCE: Aristotle was charged with impiety, a standard way for Athenians to get rid of those he dislikes. He flees but only lives a year before dieing at 61</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="two-important-lessons-from-his-biography">Two important lessons from his biography</h2>

<ul>
  <li>He is the son of a physician, a doctor</li>
  <li>His overarching passion is biology, where the includes studying the characteristic behaviors, parts, and appearances of different species of animals. He disects and wants to figure out why animals work in their different ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>How might a doctor and biologist approach various questions. Suppose, they learn about a new species. Let us give it the name Gothica. We would like to know what it is for a Gothica to live a good life? Would they suffer if we place them in a zoo? What about building a pipeline through their habitat? 
	- I want them to think about observing what they do, what activities they perform. 
	- I want them to also observe what’s unique or different from Gothicas. 
	- Finally, I want them to think about dissecting, or looking inside the Gothica.</p>

<p>Aristotle wants to know about why do anything? What is a worthwhile human life? But he has no  truck for people who think only about religion, or philosophy, or generally ignroe human beings. His starting point is, he thinks, the obvious fact that there are humans living and attempting to live worthwhile lives. But just as not every Gothica lives a good Gothica life—perhaps it sits around on a log all day while his friends flourish. Not all human lives are worthwhile. So, we’re going to look at the beliefs and desires that people really have. We’re also going to look at the things that they really pursue. We’re going to take all that data has our starting points.</p>

<h2 id="reading-aristotle">Reading Aristotle</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bekker pages. Two columns per page. 35-40 lines per column. Everything is referred to. Books have introduction, notes, and glossary.</li>
  <li>Why is it so hard?</li>
  <li>Nothing published survives. It’s highly condensed. We are more like miners or archeologists. There are nuggest of gold in here, but we have to dig to find them.</li>
  <li>Greek. Here is an example. Eudaimonia.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>3)	“Ethics”
a)	This word translates ἠθικός
b)	Also, was translated into Latin as ethicus
c)	So, you can see why that’s the word we use
d)	One big question we will pursue in this course is, what is Aristotle’s Ethics
i)	That is, what project is he pursuing here
ii)	And, how does it related to what gets called “Ethics” nowadays
e)	There seem to be obvious differences between what he is doing and what, say, deontologists or consequentialists have focused on since the 19th century
i)	Those in many ways engage the question “what makes actions right or wrong”
ii)	And while Aristotle does seem to talk a lot about how one ought to act in one sense of “ought to” it’s not clear he is concerned with the same project
f)	A recent (i.e. post 1950s) resurgence in attempt to return to the ethics as practiced by Aristotle is something we will pay particular attention to, though at the end, once we have Aristotle’s theory in view
i)	In fact, many people think that “virtue ethics” is the way that pretty much every did ethics for all of history except for a brief blip in the 19th to present (with virtue ethics being absent only for a little bit)
g)	Some people, and I might be one of them, think that it might be best to view the project of the Ethics as providing a manual for succeeding at being a human being
i)	In a sense, at being awesome at being a human being
ii)	Now you  might think that this leads to severe egoism or selfishness, but Aristotle seems to think that, in order for a human being to be awesome at being a human being, that person has to be virtuous in a somewhat conventional sense; temperance, wisdom courage are there, but also justice, benevolence and generosity seem required
iii)	So, in one sense, you might say, we can have manuals that tell you how to be a good carpenter, doctor, sailor, perhaps even parent, friend etc.
iv)	Perhaps the ethics is a manual for saying how to be a good human being</p>
