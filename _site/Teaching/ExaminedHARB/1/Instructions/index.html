<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Welcome to Philosophy 101. I’m Dr. Scott O’Connor and I’ll be your instructor for the next 7 weeks. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I received a Masters Degree in Philosophy from Oxford University and a Doctorate Degree in Philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are Ancient Philosophy and Metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on my <a href="http://scottoconnor.org">website</a> and find a picture of me <a href="http://www.njcu.edu/philosophy/faculty/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O’Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No ‘hey’, ‘yo’, ‘what’s up’, smiley face, etc.</p>

<h3 id="course-location">Course Location</h3>

<p>This course is administered through Blackboard. You will find all course documents, quizzes, assignments, grades, and messages in the Blackboard site. You can also access the some documents, but not the quizzes, on my website <a href="http:\\scoconno.github.io/Teaching/Intro/">here.</a> Not everything is contained on my site, so it’s important that you navigate through the course by using Blackboard.</p>

<h3 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h3>

<p>You can find the syllabus <a href="http://scoconno.github.io/Teaching/Intro/Syllabus.pdf">here</a>. Compare a syllabus to the rules of the roads. During your driving test, you will be expected to know the rules. Your tester will never take ‘I didn’t read the rule book’ as an excuse. Likewise, the syllabus outlines the essential workload, policies, and due dates for this course. Before you do anything else, read the syllabus carefully. If you have questions, please message me through Blackboard.</p>

<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>

<p>This course has 7 modules. Each module will become available on the first day of the week, e.g., Week 1 becomes available on day 1, which is Monday, July 6th. Week 2 becomes available on July 13th, and so on. Apart from Week 7, you will have 1 week to complete each module. While there are some variations in the modules, each one is built around the following components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Module instructions.</li>
  <li>A handout that reviews the assigned reading.</li>
  <li>A multiple choice reading quiz. Once you start you have 60 consecutive minutes to complete it.</li>
  <li>Public office hours: a discussion board in which you can ask questions about course content and mechanics. Your questions and my responses are public.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, modules may also include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A video clip.</li>
  <li>A discussion question.</li>
  <li>An essay question.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Again, read the syllabus carefully. Just as you would never take a prescription without reading the instructions first, do not start this course without reading the syllabus first.</li>
  <li>Read my brief introduction to philosophy and watch the accompanying video clip.</li>
  <li>Complete Module 1.</li>
</ol>
