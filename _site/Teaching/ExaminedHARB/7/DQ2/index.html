<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>There are many claims that you agree with. Many you don’t agree with. As a philosopher, your job is to think about the arguments for and against claims. It’s not that important whether you believe the conclusions of these argument. What’s important is your evaluation of the argument for those conclusions. In order to do that, you need to learn how to think with someone’s views, even if they are radically different from your own. So, in this prompt you will be asked to defend the existence of God. Next week you will be asked to try prove that he does not exist. Again, it’s not important whether you believe that God does or does not exist. What’s important is being able to work through the arguments on both sides.</p>

<h3 id="prompt">Prompt</h3>

<p>You are a religious leader concerned about the teaching of evolutionary biology in high schools. You think that only God could explain the existence of life. The local school board is accepting public submissions on the issue, but they emphasize that submissions longer than 250 words will automatically be rejected. Write a short letter clearly explaining the Design Argument, i.e., arguing that complexity in nature is proof that God exists.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> The members of the School Board are not philosophers. Your job here is to explain a piece of complex philosophy to smart lay people. Use examples, simple vocabulary, etc.</p>
