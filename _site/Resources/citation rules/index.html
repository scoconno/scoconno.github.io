        <h3 id="in-text-citation-rules">In-text citation rules</h3>

<p>The author’s last name and the page number(s) from which the quotation or paraphrase is taken must appear in the text, and a complete reference should appear on your Works Cited page. The author’s name may appear either in the sentence itself or in parentheses following the quotation or paraphrase, but the page number(s) should always appear in the parentheses, not in the text of your sentence. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wordsworth stated that Romantic poetry was marked by a “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings” (263).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Romantic poetry is characterized by the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings” (Wordsworth 263).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wordsworth extensively explored the role of emotion in the creative process (263).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both citations in the examples above, (263) and (Wordsworth 263), tell readers that the information in the sentence can be located on page 263 of a work by an author named Wordsworth. If readers want more information about this source, they can turn to the Works Cited page, where, under the name of Wordsworth, they would find the following information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wordsworth, William. Lyrical Ballads. London: Oxford UP, 1967. Print.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="short-quotations">Short quotations</h3>

<p>To indicate short quotations (fewer than four typed lines of prose or three lines of verse) in your text, enclose the quotation within double quotation marks. Provide the author and specific page citation (in the case of verse, provide line numbers) in the text, and include a complete reference on the Works Cited page. Punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and semicolons should appear after the parenthetical citation. Question marks and exclamation points should appear within the quotation marks if they are a part of the quoted passage but after the parenthetical citation if they are a part of your text.</p>

<p>For example, when quoting short passages of prose, use the following examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to some, dreams express “profound aspects of personality” (Foulkes 184), though others disagree.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Foulkes’s study, dreams may express “profound aspects of personality” (184).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible that dreams may express “profound aspects of personality” (Foulkes 184)?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="long-quotations">Long Quotations</h3>

<p>For quotations that are more than four lines of prose or three lines of verse, place quotations in a free-standing block of text and omit quotation marks. Start the quotation on a new line, with the entire quote indented one inch from the left margin; maintain double-spacing. Only indent the first line of the quotation by an additional quarter inch if you are citing multiple paragraphs. Your parenthetical citation should come after the closing punctuation mark. When quoting verse, maintain original line breaks. (You should maintain double-spacing throughout your essay.)</p>

<p>For example, when citing more than four lines of prose, use the following examples:</p>

<p>Nelly Dean treats Heathcliff poorly and dehumanizes him throughout her narration:
&gt; They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room, and I had no more sense, so, I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it would be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw’s door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house. (Bronte 78)</p>

<h3 id="works-cited">Works Cited</h3>

<p>Basic Format</p>

<p>The author’s name or a book with a single author’s name appears in last name, first name format. The basic form for a book citation is:</p>

<p>Lastname, Firstname. Title of Book. City of Publication: Publisher, Year of Publication. Medium of Publication.
Book with One Author</p>

<p>Gleick, James. Chaos: Making a New Science. New York: Penguin, 1987. Print.
Henley, Patricia. The Hummingbird House. Denver: MacMurray, 1999. Print.</p>
