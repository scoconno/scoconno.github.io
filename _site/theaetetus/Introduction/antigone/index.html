  <h1 class="page-title">Antigone</h1>
  <p>In the middle of the 5th century BC Sophocles wrote his Antigone. It describes a conflict between the conscience of an individual and the demands of the state and the law.</p>

<p>Two brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, are leaders of the opposite sides in Thebes’ civil war. Both die fighting each other for the throne. Creon, the new ruler of Thebes, has decided that Eteocles will be honored and Polyneices will be in public shame, i.e., his body will not be sanctified by holy rites and will lie unburied on the battlefield, prey for carrion animals like worms and vultures, the harshest punishment at the time.</p>

<p>In Athens, the penalty for traitors and temple-robbers was exhorismos, i.e., throwing the corpse beyond the boundaries of Athenian territory without burial.  Traitors were sometimes executed by being thrown from a cliff into a ‘pit’ (hence without opportunity for proper burial).</p>

<p>Antigone and Ismene are the sisters of the dead Polyneices and Eteocles. Antigone brings Ismene outside the palace gates late at night for a secret meeting: Antigone wants to bury Polyneices’ body, in defiance of Creon’s edict. Ismene refuses to help her, but she is unable to stop Antigone.</p>

<p>Antigone’s decision to disobey the law and to follow her own convictions about what she ought to do leads to her death. Creon, furious, orders the Sentry to find the culprit or face death himself. Creon questions her after sending the Sentry away, and she does not deny what she has done. She argues unflinchingly with Creon about the morality of the edict and the morality of her actions. Creon decides to sbury Antigone alive in a cave. By not killing her directly, he hopes to pay the minimal respects to the gods.</p>

<p>Nearly half a century later, in 399 BC, Socrates was put to death for following his own conscience against the state and the law. He was accused of undermining belief in the religion of the state, and of ‘corrupting the young men’ by his philosophical activity. Just as other characters in the Antigone regard Antigone as a subversive and anti-social influence, Aristophanes’ play the Clouds represents Socrates as a subversive and dangerous influence on religion and morality.</p>
