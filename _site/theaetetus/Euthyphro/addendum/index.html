  <h1 class="page-title">Addendum</h1>
  <h2 id="ss-objection-to-es-third-definition">S’s objection to E’s third definition</h2>

<p>E defines piety as what is dear to all the gods. This passes the generality and uniqueness tests. But S thinks it fails a third test that he introduces by asking,  “Is the pious loved by the gods because it’s pious? Or is it pious because it’s loved?’’</p>

<p>He wants to argue that piety # being bod loved. His strategy is to show that things are pious because they are bod loved. Why is this a good strategy? Here’s a general point his argument relies upon:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>x is F</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>x is G</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>x’s being F is explained by x’s being G.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, F # G</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In general, if one thing explains another, those two things are not identical. Compare: the rooster crows because the sun rises. Therefore, the sun rising and the rooster crowing are different events.</p>

<p>If S can show that X’s being pious explains why all the gods love X, then he has shown that piety # being loved by all the gods. (We can drop the ‘all’ qualifier below).</p>

<p>His argument relies on a crucial distinction between something’s being <em>X</em>ed and something’s <em>X</em>ing. For instance, there is a difference being John being carried and John carrying something; being led and leading; being seen and seeing. Similarly, there is a distinction between being loved and loving. The former is about the state of being the recipient of love from another. The latter is about the state in which one is actively loving another.</p>

<p>S then claims that something <em>X</em>ing <em>Y</em> is prior to <em>Y</em>’s being <em>X</em>ed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we ask “Why is this piece of chalk being carried (led, seen)?’’ the answer is “Because Dr. O’Connor is carrying (leading, seeing) it’’.</li>
  <li>If we ask “Why is Dr.  O’Connor carrying this piece of chalk?’’ the answer is <strong>not</strong> “Because the piece of chalk is being carried by Dr. O’Connor’’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apply this to our problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>X loves Y.</li>
  <li>Y is loved by X.</li>
  <li>X does not love Y because Y is loved by X.</li>
  <li>Y is loved by X because X loves Y.</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, the gods loving X is prior to X being loved by the gods, i.e., the fact that the gods love X explains why X is being loved by the gods, not the other way around. Or to put it slightly differently, the fact that X is receiving love from the gods does not explain why the gods are actively loving X. We should really say that X is receiving love from the gods because the gods are actively loving X.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, we ask, “Why do the gods love X?’’. There are two possible answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Option 1: Because X is loved by the gods.
    <ul>
      <li>Absurd! Remember the carrying of the chalk: the answer to “Why is Dr. O’Connor carrying the chalk’’ was not “Because the chalk is being carried by Dr. O’Connor’’.</li>
      <li>We have argued above that X is  (being) loved by the Gods because the Gods (actively) love X.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Option 2: Because X is pious. What, then, is the relationship between piety and being loved by the gods? Either (1) piety = being loved by the gods, or (2) piety # being loved by the Gods. If (1), S argues that we commit the same error as option 1, so (2) must be true. Argument against (1):
    <ul>
      <li>Assume that ‘to be pious’ = ‘to be loved by the Gods’, i.e., ‘X is loved by the Gods’ means that ‘X is pious’.</li>
      <li>If X, a pious thing, is loved by the Gods because it is pious, then X is loved by the Gods because X is loved by the Gods (by substituting identicals).</li>
      <li>But, we’ve shown that to be impossible.</li>
      <li>Therefore: to be pious # to be loved by the gods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>S has shown that pious # to be loved by the gods. At best, these two strictly correlate with one another. But don’t get too bogged down in this specific argument; perhaps you are unsure how exactly S argues that pious # to be loved by the gods. The general point you want to take away from this week is that S believes an adequate definition of X must satisfy three conditions:</p>

<p><strong>X is defined as P if and only if:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>General: everything which is X is also P.</li>
  <li>Unique: everything which is P is also X.</li>
  <li>Explanatory: everything which is X is X precisely because of its being P; being P explains why X things are X.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you read the dialogs, you will encounter S asking supposed experts to tell him the nature of various things. When he argues with someone that they fail to adequately define something, you should ask which of these conditions the relevant answer does not fulfill.</p>
