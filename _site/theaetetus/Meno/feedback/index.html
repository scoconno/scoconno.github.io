  <h1 class="page-title">Gobbet observations</h1>
  <p>I’ve read several gobbets, and I want to make a preliminary note about them. Let’s go over what is required for the content and assessment section. Consider passage 1 from the <em>Meno</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And so with size and strength? If a woman is strong, that strength will be the same and have the same form, for by “the same” I mean that strength is no different as far as being strength, whether in a man or a woman. Or do you think there is a difference? (72e)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Content</strong></p>

<p>In order to analyze the content of this passage, you need to talk explicitly about the explicit claims and the language used to express them. Some of you analyzed the content by, for instance, saying something general about Socrates’ attitude to Meno. But that’s not telling me about what is written. To analyze this particular passage, you need to discuss size and strength. What exact claims are Socrates making about these? To explain them, you could use examples. For instance, you could write, something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An elephant is strong, ants are strong, Serena Williams is strong, and Michael Phelps is strong. Despite the differences between all these beings, Socrates believes that the essence of the strength they each possess is the same. By this, he means that that Q in virtue of which each thing is strong is the same in each case. Perhaps Q is ‘ability to lift something at least half your body weight.’ If Socrates can show that the essence of strength for different types of strong beings is the same, then he thinks he has shown that the essence of virtue too will be the same for different types of virtuous beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>

<p>I saw a similar problem with some of the assessments. You need to say something very specific about the explicit passage. Telling me that Socrates keeps asking questions that prove Meno wrong doesn’t tell me what you think about the explicit points about size and strength in this passage. Do you think Socrates is right about size and strength? If not, why? If he is right, does it show whatever he wants it to show about virtue? You could raise an objection by claiming that virtue is unlike strength and size. Couldn’t one accept the points about size and strength and not the point about virtue?</p>
