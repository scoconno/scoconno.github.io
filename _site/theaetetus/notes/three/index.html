        <p>The Secret Doctrine is introduced to provide support for Protagoras’s claim that something is the case for one if and only if it appears so to one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Qualities have no independent existence in time and space (153d6-e1).</li>
  <li>Qualities do not exist except in perceptions of them (153e3–154a8). They do not exist in the sense organ or in the object perceived.</li>
  <li>(The dice paradox:) changes in a thing’s qualities are not so much changes in that thing as in perceptions of that thing (154a9–155c6).</li>
  <li>Flux theory is used to develop a Protagorean/Heracleitean account of perception, to replace accounts based on the object/property ontology of common sense (155c-157c.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The flux theory distinguishes kinds of “process” (kinêsis), i.e., of flux, in two ways: as fast or slow, and as active or passive. Hence there are four such processes.</p>

<p>Fast motion 
Slow motion</p>

<p>power of acting
power of acting upon</p>

<p>There are two parents, the sense organ and an object that acts upon it. They have various powers to act upon and be acted upon. By virtue of these, when they do interact there are two offspring, a perceptible property and the perceiving</p>

<p>The offspring undergo fast change moving between both parents and do not remain in one place. The perceiving and perceptible properties cannot exist without each other and without the parents that created them. They are generated together in each encounter between perceiver and perceived object, thus one cannot separate them. The quality is essentially tied to one’s perception of it.</p>

<p>The parents undergo slow change. The ego becomes a seeing eye. The stone becomes cold. There is a question about this. In what sense is the new seeing eye created? How was the non-seeing and the now seeing eye related?</p>

<p>Well now Theaetetus, what does this story mean to convey to us? What is its bearing on what came before? Do you see?</p>

<p>A perceptual property belongs to a thing only in relation to a perception, and a perception can be attributed to a perceiver only in relation to the perceived object. This is meant to be like the dice example.</p>
