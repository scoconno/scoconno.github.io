        ## Introduction

We will discuss three doctrines over the next few weeks: 

1.  Theaetetus proposal: Knowledge is perception
2. Protagoras' Doctrine: Man is the measure of all things. 
3. Secrete Doctrine: All is flux.

1 is Theaetetus's second attempt at explaining what knowledge is. This attempt is not yet a fully 'born' idea that can be tested. See 160e for discussion of first born child. See 157d for what they plan to do. So, just like a midwife who helps induce labor, Socrates helps Theaetetus develop his idea by suggesting that it involves two further ideas, that man is the measure of all things and that all is flux. Our goal over the next few weeks is to first understand what these doctrines are and to try identify how they supposedly relate to the proposal that knowledge is perception. We will then look at Socrates's objections to the proposal. 

## Part 1

Our focus this week is from 151d--155c. This text can be divided into five smaller sections:

+ 151d-e:  Theaetetus defines knowledge as perception. 
+ 152b-c:  Socrates says this theory relates to Protagoras's claim that man is the measure of all things
+ 152c8–152e: Socrates introduces the secrete doctrine, the claim that everything is in flux. 
+ 152e1–153d:  Socrates explains why philosophers have thought the secrete doctrine is true. 
+ 153d6-155c6: Socrates discusses consequences of the secret doctrine.  

## Knowledge = perception

If this account is an advance over the previous one, then it must be unique and general, i.e., it must say the following

+ x is a perceiving iff x is a knowing.

This claim says that every act of knowing is an act of perceiving and every act of perceiving is an act of knowing. If correct, there cannot be an act of knowing that is not an act of perceiving, e.g., you can never know X if you did not perceive X. And there cannot be a case of perceiving that cannot be a case of knowing, e.g., you can never perceive X without knowing X. 

It is important to distinguish two claims: 

+ S knows X and S perceives X
+ S knows that X is F and S perceives that X is F. 

Socrates is focused on the latter claims. Theaetetus claims knowing x is F is the same as perceiving that x is F. 

## What do we mean by 'perception'? 

Perception is restricted to the senses. So, on one version of Theaetetus's claim, the only things that we can know are the things that we see, hear, touch, etc. And, more controversially, if we see, hear, touch, etc., something as F, then we know it is F. 



## Relativism

There is a position, or groups of position, in philosophy that has continually fascinated philosophers: reality can be one way for me and a different way for you. The idea is that reality, or some portion of reality, exists, or at least is how it is, because of how it appears to me and not in and of itself. So, for instance, moral relativists say that murder is wrong not in and of itself but only because it appears to me to be wrong. If it appears ok to someone, then it is ok for that person. A moral relativist says that those who think stealing to save your children is immoral are not in disagreement with who those believe it is moral; both are right because what it is for this to be moral or not is just dependent on what it appears to one. 

The view seems plausible for certain kinds of features. Consider the property of being tasty. Are brussels sprouts tasty? Some people enjoy them. Others do not. Whose right? Presumably, both of them are right because taste is not a property that brussels sprouts have independently of them being tasted. 

The view we are interested in says that the entire world is somehow like this, that the world is exactly as each of us think it is even though we have different experiences of it. 

## Measure doctrine

>	Man is the measure of all thing, of the things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not.

There are various ways to understand this claim and the examples Socrates uses to illustrate it. 

Things are for you as they appear to you. 

**Alethic Relativism:** "The wind is cold" is true relative to me and not absolutely true. The sentence could be true relative to one person and false relative to another. 

**Perceptual Relativism:** "The wind is cold" is not a complete sentence, so it cannot be true or false. "The wind is cold for me" is complete, and so is either true or false. Compare: "John is taller than" vs "John is taller than Bob". The first sentence cannot be true or false because it is incomplete. "The wind is cold for John" is absolutely true. 

**Infallibilism:** "The wind is cold" and "The wind is not cold" are both absolutely true. The wind, in effect, becomes cold when I believe it to be cold and it becomes not cold when you believe it to be warm.
