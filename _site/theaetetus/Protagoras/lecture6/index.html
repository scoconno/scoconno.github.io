<h4 id="questions">Questions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>First question might just be about akrasia. Can you knowingly do something wrong? If you know that doing F is good, can you fail to do so? Could get them to talk about food.</li>
  <li>To set this up, I’ll need to set up the distinction between knowledge and mere belief. Or do I? Is akrasia an issue between believing F is wrong and doing it anyway? Or is it between knowledge and action?</li>
  <li>I could talk about serial killers, maybe that movie about vietnam war. Anything from a movie? I think it should be focused on other people—any legal issue I can bring up?</li>
  <li>Second question might focus on teaching morality.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="e-334c">317e-334c</h4>

<p>Protagoras (a well-known sophist) claims to teach his students “sound
deliberation” (<em>euboulia</em>), which Socrates equates with the “art of
citizenship” (<em>politikê technê</em>) and “virtue” (<em>aretê</em>)</p>

<p>S wonders whether virtue can be taught (P’s claim presupposes that it
can)</p>

<p>S asks P, “Is virtue a single thing, with justice and temperance and
piety its parts, or are the things I have just listed all names for a
single entity” (329d) Two options for “parts”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the sense in which the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears are
 parts of the face (heterogenous parts)&lt;/span&gt;</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>In the sense in which there are “parts” of a block of gold
    (homogenous parts)&lt;/span&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>S asks further whether someone can have some parts of virtue <em>without</em>
having all of them</p>

<ul>
  <li><span>P says yes, and points to (allegedly) courageous but unjust
people, just but unwise people, …</span></li>
</ul>

<p>S argues that the virtues do form a unity, each of them being some kind
of knowledge/understanding (<em>epistêmê</em>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><span>P (begrudgingly) agrees that all the virtues <em>except</em> courage may be kinds of knowledge</span></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hedonism">Hedonism</h4>

<p>Pleasant things are good insofar as they are pleasant (pleasure is <em>a</em>
good)</p>

<p>Pleasant things alone are good (pleasure is <em>the</em> good)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span>[B1]: One’s present pleasure is the good</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span>[B2]: Maximized pleasure is the good (S attributes this view
to the many, 354a-c)</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>S also assumes that all pleasures and pains are “commensurable”—all
pleasures and pains can be weighed against each other; thus, in
principle, all pleasures and pains can be ranked</p>

<h4 id="the-experience-of-akrasia-being-overcome-lack-of-self-control-weakness-of-will-as-reported-by-the-many-hoi-polloi">The experience of “<em>akrasia</em>,” (“being overcome,” “lack of self-control,” “weakness of will”), as reported by “the many” (<em>hoi polloi</em>)</h4>

<p>One’s knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) that an action is bad can be overcome by desire, pleasure, pain, love, fear, etc. (352b, d, 353c)</p>

<p>Two explicit versions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>X does B, i) knowing B is bad, ii) when able not to do B,
 and iii) overwhelmed by pleasure&lt;/span&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>X does not do G, i) knowing G is good, ii) when able to do
 G, and iii) overwhelmed by pleasure&lt;/span&gt;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="socrates-aim">Socrates’ aim</h4>

<p>The probandum (“thing to be proved”): Knowledge “rules” in a person—if X
knows that A is good, X will do A, if X can; if X knows that A is bad, X
will <em>not</em> do X, if X can</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span>If S proves this, he will have shown that the akratic
situation is impossible or misdescribed</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span>Given that S suspects virtue is some kind of knowledge, it is
clear why he wants to argue for this</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="socrates-argument">Socrates’ argument</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[P1]Pleasure is the good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[P2]All pleasures and pains are commensurable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[P3] The akratic situation, when re-described in accordance with [P1], amounts to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>1* X did B, knowing B to be bad and able not to do it,
  because X was overcome by good =&lt;/span&gt;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>X did something painful, knowing it to be painful and able not to do it, because X was overcome by pleasure</span></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[P4] In 1* the good/pleasure is less than the overall bad/pain X chose to get</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[P5] So in both cases, X chose to do what X knew was worse/more painful instead of what was less bad or less painful</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[C] Therefore, it is only ignorance of the relative weights of the
alternatives that can explain X’s selection of the worse</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>S re-describes the akratic situation as being a manifestation of
“ignorance” (<em>amathia</em>)—the “power of appearance” leads a person to
miscalculate the relative weight of an immediate pleasure (e.g. just as
seeing something in a distance can lead us to judge (mistakenly) that it
is smaller than something that is up close)</p>

<p>S uses this conclusion to argue that even courage is a kind of
knowledge/understanding, namely knowledge of “what is and is not to be
feared” (360d8-9)</p>

<h4 id="problems">Problems</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is hedonism plausible in its own right?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P6 is only plausible if all desire is for the maximized good or that there is only one kind of desire/faculty of desire. Are there desires that are not aimed at the good?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does S illegitimately move between Hedonism B1 and B2 in his argument?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if S’s argument succeeds, is there an epistemic problem? If virtue is to guarantee correct action, and virtue is a kind of
knowledge/understanding, will this require unrealistic demands of
knowing <em>all</em> the future consequences of our actions?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
