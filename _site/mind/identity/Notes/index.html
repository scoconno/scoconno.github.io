<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We have seen that the behaviorist defines a mental state in terms of physiological responses and bodily movements. Pain, on this view, just was a characteristic set of such responses and movements. A radically different view claims that mental states should be defined in terms of brain states. A brain state is what is <em>going on</em> in your brain, i.e., nerve cells firing. A mental state is a state or condition some mind might be in, like seeing, or thinking, being in pain, etc. So, thoughts, pains, desires, beliefs, etc., are all mental states. The mind-brain identit theory claims that each mental state is identical to some brain state, e.g., pain is identical to some nerves, in particular C-fibres, firing.</p>

<p>How should we udnerstand this claim? There is clearly a correlation between mental states and brain states. Examples include injuries, drugs, food. Hit the brain, change the mind. When we engage in various mental activities, parts of the brain light up. See, for instance, this video about the technology that is being developed to read someone’s thougts from their brain activities. The scientists have discovered that when you think of, say, the letter ‘A’, a particular neuron fires. Since they can detect that neuron, they can infer that when that neuron fires, you must be thinking about ‘A’. Eventually, these machines will be able to read all of our thoughts by detecing the relevant brain activity associated with those thoughts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need to say something about neural features.  Various nerve signals cause central neural processes that underlie conscious experiences</li>
</ul>

<p>Mind-Brain Correlation Thesis. For each type M of mental event that occurs to an organism o, there exists a brain state of kind B (M’s “neural correlate” or “substrate”) such that M occurs to o at time t if and only if B occurs to o at t.</p>

<p>This states a strict correlation between brain states and mental states. Whenever you have a certain type of mental state, you should have a certain type of brain state. Whenever you have a certain kind of brain state, you should have the same kind of mental state. This is correlation has law like regularity. It  means that no change in the mind can occur unless there is a change in the brain</p>

<p>Different explanations could be offered for this correlation and we will see that mind-identity theory offers one such explanation. Let’s think of some simple correlations.  + Superman and Clark Kent in the same place.</p>

<p>Some are explained by F causing G. Others are explained by F and G having a common cause, two aspects of the same process. Kim goes through a-f types of correlation and asks how mind and brain are correlated.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Causal Interactionism:</em> Descartes</li>
  <li><em>Presestablished Harmony:</em> Kind of like clocks with a common historic cause.</li>
  <li><em>Occasionalism:</em> A constant intervener.</li>
  <li><em>Double Aspect Theory:</em> Two aspects of an underlying substance. They do not cause each other. Spinoza.</li>
  <li><em>Epiphenomenalism:</em> Huxley claims that conscious states are caused by neural events in the brain and mental states can do nothing to the brain.</li>
  <li><em>Emergentism</em> No explanation for the phenomena. The correlations are brute facts.</li>
  <li>*Psychoneural (or Psychophysical, Mind-Body) Identity Theory: mental states are identical to physical processes in the brain</li>
</ul>

<p>The mind-brain identity theory understands this correlation in a very special away. They claim that the best way to explain the correlation is not to try identify some cause for how two distinct things might always co-occur, they think that there is just one thing in the first place. If mental properties (mental states) are identical to properties of brains (brain states), then this would easily and neatly explain mind brain correlation.  Consider, for instance, the property of being water and the property of being H20. Whenver something has the property of being water it also has the property of being H20. This correlation, the fact that both properties always co-occur, is explained just by the fact that these are not two properties at all. The property of being water and the property of being H2O are one and the same property. Likewise, the mind-brain identity theory claims that property of being in a certain mental state is identical to the property of being in a certain brain state. There is no surprise that both properties co-occur because they are one and the same property. e.</p>

<h2 id="arguments-for-mind-brain-identity-theory">Arguments for Mind-Brain Identity Theory</h2>

<h3 id="occams-razor">1. Occam’s Razor</h3>

<p>Occam’s (or Ockham’s) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham.  Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born. The principle states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.<br />
+ What can be down with fewer assumption should not be done with more.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate”
Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora”
Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adopt simplest ontology possible.</p>

<p>Give examples of conspiracy theories. Choose the theory that has the fewest hypotheses and assumptions.</p>

<p>So, mind-brain identity might explain correlation by satisfying both examples.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton stated the rule: “We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.”</p>

<p>Distinguish two types of simplicity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Axiom simplicity: the number and conciseness of the theory’s basic principles.</li>
  <li>Ontological simplicity: the number of kinds of entities postulated by the theory.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="causation">2. Causation</h3>

<p>An Argument for the Identity Theory
1)  Some conscious states (i.e., mental states)
are the causes of some physical events. For example, my desire causes me to move.
2)  But (according to science) the only things that cause physical events are other physical events.
3)  So, at least some mental states and events must be identical with some physical states and events.</p>

<p>The Argument
•  1) At least some mental events (like choosing to do something) cause physical events.
•  2) But only physical events can cause physical events.
•  3) So, at least some mental events must be physical events.
– i.e., at least some mental states are identical to brain states.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mental events cause physical events.</li>
  <li>Only physical events can cause physical events.</li>
  <li>Mental events are physical events, i.e., are identical to brain events.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="arguments-against-mind-brain-identity-theory">Arguments against Mind-Brain Identity Theory</h2>
<p>According to the Identity Theorist, the fact that mental states are caused by states of the world is the same fact as the fact that brain states are caused by states of the world.</p>

<p>For the Identity Theorist, this is the same as the claim that certain brain states cause actions. Again, the evidence for this is very strong.</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oka8hqsOzg</p>

<p>All of our objections will rely on the following principles
Leibniz’ Law
n  If A and B are identical, then whatever properties one has the other must have too.
–  That is, if A and B are the very same thing, then “they” must have exactly the same properties.
n  So if A and B have different properties, they cannot be identical.
n  So, if mental states and physical states have different properties, they cannot be identical.</p>

<p>If X = Y, then X and Y have all the same properties.</p>

<p>[Converse] If X and Y don’t have all the same properties, then X ≠ Y.</p>

<p>Property: drives a motorcycle</p>

<p>Sally = the tallest person in the room.
Sally drives a motorcycle.
Therefore, the tallest person in the room drives a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Property: being red</p>

<p>My car is red (has the property of being red.
That car is not red (does not have the property).
Since my car and that car don’t have all the same properties, that car is not my car.</p>

<p>Property: boils at 100 degrees Celsius</p>

<p>Water = H2O.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Therefore, H2O boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Property: boils at 100 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Water = H2O.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Therefore, H2O boils at 100 degrees Celsius</p>

<p>If Mind-Brain Identity Theory is correct, then Leibniz Law requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If mental state A and brain state B are numerically identical, then A and B are qualitatively identical.</li>
</ul>

<p>If, on the other hand, A and B vary in even one property, they A and B are not numerically identical.</p>

<p>My pain [a mental state] is in my foot.
No brain state is in my foot.
Therefore, my pain is not any brain state.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-argument-from-certain">Application 1: argument from certain</h3>

<p>The Argument from Certainty
•  1. I can be certain of my mental states (e.g., pain).
•  2. I cannot be certain of my brain states.
•  3. So, mental states have properties (of being such that I can be certain of them) that brain states lack.
•  4. So, mental states cannot be identical to brain states.</p>

<p>Question: does Leibniz Law apply to <em>intensional</em> properties?</p>

<p>•  If A and B are the very same thing, then A and B must have the same intrinsic properties.
– i.e., not merely involving beliefs about it.
•  But being “believed by me to like gardening” and being “something I can have certainty about” are not intrinsic properties.
•  So, the fact that I know or believe different things about mental states and physical states doesn’t prove they aren’t identical.</p>

<h3 id="application-2-the-argument-from-color">Application 2: The Argument from Color</h3>

<p>•  1. I am experiencing a green after-image.
•  2. No brain states are green.
•  3. So (by Leibniz’ Law) my after-image is not identical with any brain state because one is green (the after image) and the other (the brain state) isn’t.</p>

<p>But, Carruthers argues, it is simply false that after images are (literally) green.</p>

<p>Question: is my after-image really purle?</p>

<h3 id="application-3--multiple-realizability">Application 3–Multiple Realizability</h3>

<p>The multiple realizability thesis states that a single mental kind (property, state, event) can be realized by many distinct physical kinds (property, state, event).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pain has the property of being correlated with C-fibres firing in humans.</li>
  <li>Pain does not have the property of being correlated with C-fibres firing in sharks.</li>
  <li>Pain is not identical to C-fibres firing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note 1: premise 2 could be replaced with examples of plants feeling pain, non-carbon based life-form feeling pain, synthetic creatures (robots) feeling pain.</p>

<p>Note 2: do these things really feel pain? If they do, is their feeling of pain the same type of mental state as the pain humans feel?</p>

<p>If souls, squid, aliens, and robots can all feel pain, then pain can’t be a brain state, because these things don’t have brains.</p>

<p>Maybe all human pains are brain states, but being a mental state type is not the same thing as being a brain state type.
 Money is multiply reliasible.</p>

<p>The Identity Theory says that mental states and certain brain states are type-identical.
The theory is consistent with physics and explains the causal interactions between mind and world (maybe not rationality).
A principal objection to the theory is the apparent multiple realizability of mental states.</p>
