  <h3 id="mind-as-immaterial-substance">Mind as Immaterial Substance</h3>

<p>What is it to have a mind? If we asked Plato or Aristotle, two Greek philosophers living c.2500 years ago, they would answer that to have a mind is to have a soul. The English word ‘soul’ translates the Greek work ‘psuche’ and the latin word ‘anima’. You likely recognize ‘psuche’ if you are a psychology major; ‘psychology’ roughly translates as ‘the science of soul’. Psychologists today do not think that what it is to have a mind is to have a soul, but it is worth thinking about why our predecessors associated soul and mind. We’ll do that by focusing on the 17th century philosopher Descartes (1596-1650), who is associated closely associated with the view.</p>

<p>(IMAGE OF DESCARTES)</p>

<p>Descare was born in La Haye in the Touraine region of France. In 1606 or 1607, he entered the newly founded Jesuit College of La Fleche, where he remained until 1614 or 1615. He spent five to six years studying classical Latin, Greek, the major poets and orators (e.g., Cicero) followed by three years of philosophical training based on the philosophy of Aristotle, where he studied logic, morals, physics, and metaphysics. He also spent significant time on mathematics. Before joining the army, he also studied to be a lawyer. In 1629, he settled in the Netherlands in 1629  where he had one daughter (Francine) by a  servant (Helene). In 1649, he moved to Sweden to instruct Queen Christina in philosophy. They met at five in the morning, for five hours, three days a week. He died of respiratory infection on Feb. 11th, 1650.</p>

<p>Descartes is the founder of modern philosophy. His intellectual character is well illustrated by his deep skepticism about the received knowledge of the time: 
&gt; From my childhood they fed me books, and because people convinced me that these could give me clear and certain knowledge of everything useful in life, I was extremely eager to learn them. But no sooner had I completed the whole course of study that normally takes one straight into the ranks of the ‘learned’ than I completely changed my mind about what this education could do for me. For I found myself tangled in so many doubts and errors that I came to think that my attempts to become educated had done me no good except to give me a steadily widening view of my ignorance!(Discourse, I.2)</p>

<p>Descartes’ skepticism motivated him to reexamine many central tenants in mathematics, optics, and physics. Not only did he identify mistakes in these areas, he radically changed our understanding of them. One commentator writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Descartes went far beyond the Copernican hypothesis that our Sun lies at the center of the universe with the Earth moving about it. He contended that the Earth is one among many planets, revolving around many different suns distributed throughout the cosmos. He further proposed that the whole universe is made of one kind of matter, which follows one set of laws. He invented the concept of a single universe, filled with matter having a few describable properties and governed by a few laws of motion. While others, including ancient atomists and Stoics, had sketched part of this new picture, Descartes’ vision of a unified physics governed by a few laws of motion was far richer and more detailed. Its combination of breadth and unity was unprecedented in his earlier work with Beeckman, or in the works of Copernicus, Galileo, or Kepler. This unified vision set the framework for Newton’s subsequent unification of mechanics and astronomy.” (Hatfield (2003), 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="descartes-fundamental-claims">Descartes’ fundamental claims</h3>

<p>Our interest is Descartes’ contributions to the philosophy of mind, which can be summarized with the following four claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are substances of two fundamentally different kinds in the world, mental substances and material substances—or minds and bodies. The essential nature of a mind is to think, be conscious, and engage in other mental activities; the essence of a body is to have spatial extensions (a bulk) and be located in space.</li>
  <li>A human person is a composite being of a mind and a body.</li>
  <li>No mind is identical to a body.</li>
  <li>Minds and bodies causally influence each other. Some mental phenomena are causes of physical phenomena and vice versa.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fourth claim is important. Descartes thinks that there is causal interaction between mind and body. We’ll ultimately worry whether 1 and 3 are compatible with 4, but let’s first review what these claims mean and why Descartes accepts them.</p>

<h3 id="substance">Substance</h3>
<p>What does Descartes mean by ‘substance’? Reality comprises different kinds of entities. There are chairs, trees, atoms, and molecules. Many think that whatever exists is similar in one important respect: they are all physical. Philosophers use the word ‘substance’ to categorize such a general kind of thing, e.g., clouds and molecules are physical substances. But even if the only substances are physical ones, it seems that something other than the substances must exist, namely, the qualities, quantities, relations, and activities that <em>inhere</em> in these substances (P inheres in S if S somehow possesses or has P). For instance, the weight of the stone is different from the stone itself. The motion of the molecule is different from the molecule itself. Motion and weight belong to these physical substances but they are not themselves physical substances.</p>

<p>For our purposes, ‘substance’ is closely connected with another Greek word, ‘hupokeimenon’, which means roughly ‘what underlies’, or ‘subject’.  It is that which posesses qualities, quantities, relations, and activities, but it is not itself possessed by anything else.  There is an important difference between the height, weight, and swimming of Flipper the dolphin and Flipper himself. Flipper is a substance, in the sense that Flipper is a subject in which other things inhere, e.g., the swimming belongs to Flipper, the shine and weight inhere in Flipper, etc. Flipper, though, does not inhere in anything else. He is not a property of any other substance.</p>

<p>This contrast between substances and what inhere in them obviously mirrors a linguistic contrast between grammatical subjects and predicates, between ‘Flipper’ and ‘swimming’ in the sentence ‘Flipper is swimming’. But the contrast is more fundamental than the linguistic one; ‘blue’ can be used as the subject of a predicate, e.g., ‘blue is nice’. Substances can never inhere in anything else.</p>

<p>Many think that the world contains only physical substances. This means that they only subjects of properties are physical substances. We will never find, on this view, an existing substance that does not have physical attributes.</p>

<p>This is not Descartes’ view. He argues that reality comprises two radically different kinds of substances, physical (or bodily) substances, and souls (mental substance). These substances have very different features inhering in them. Minds are subjects of their own special properties like thinking, sensing, judging, and willing. These properties inhere in mind. They do not inhere in bodies. Bodies, on the other hand, are extended in space, have weight, undergo nourishment, etc. These are not properties that inhere in mind. Mind does not move or weigh anything.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize just how different these two types of substances are. A soul is simple, divine, and immutable. Our bodies are composite and perishable. A soul also seems something that can survive bodily death and decay. A body cannot survive its decay. This shouldn’t be that surprising. That which inheres in a substance cannot exist without substances. Color cannot exist without some object that has color. Substance, on the other hand, does not depend for its existence on anything it inheres in. Socrates does not need to inhere in anything for him to exist. Descartes himself wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The notion of a substance is just this—that it can exist by itself, that is without the aid of any other substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So just as some chairs could exist without one another, so too a mind and body coud exist without one another.</p>

<p>If Descartes is right, you are composed of two different substances, a physical one and a mental one. Your mind, which Descartes calls the soul, plays one role. Your body plays another. It is your mind that does your thinking, dreaming, fearing, and wanting. It is your body that does your walking, sitting, and eating, etc.</p>

<h3 id="argument-for-substance-dualism">Argument for Substance Dualism</h3>
<p>Substance dualism, then, is just the view that there exists both physical and mental substances; that you are composed of these two substances. But why accept dualism? Understanding Descartes’ argument requires that we understand some of his larger theoretical concerns and how he argued for them.</p>

<p>First, Descartes was worried about the prevailing sciences of the time. This was a time when scientists still sought to explain the motion of bodies by the so-called inherent tendencies of earth to move downward, air to rise upward, etc. Doctors still explained disease by appeal to various humors in the body. Descartes worried as to whether the various sciences of the day were making fundamental errors and suggested that we need to take stock: which of our sciences could really be trusted?  He undertook this project in several works, most importantly ‘The Meditations.’ He describes the project in this work to a friend as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will say to you, just between us, that these six Meditations contain all the foundations of my Physics. But, please, you must not say so; for those who favor Aristotle would perhaps have more difficulty in approving them; and I hope that those who will read them will unwittingly become accustomed to my principles, and will recognize the truth, before they notice that my principles destroy those of Aristotle. (Descartes, letter to Marsenne)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Descartes subsequently identified four Rules for acquiring Knowledge</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Accept as true only that for which one has proper evidence, which he calls clear and distinct perception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resolve problems into their simplest parts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move from the simple and known to the complex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thoroughly review and check one’s work to be sure it is  comprehensive and complete.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The first meditation begins by asking what can be clearly and distinctly perceived? Descartes wants to find some means/tool that would allow him test all of his beliefs. He suggests skepticism and proceeds to identify which of his beliefs, if any, are immune from doubt given the strongest skeptical challenge.</p>

<p>His first tries to identify a skeptical challenge that is sufficiently strong for this purpose, i.e., a challenge that will pertain to as many of his beliefs as possible. Some candidate challenges can be ruled out. Skepticism about vision only allows us test our beliefs about perceptible things. Descartes finally settles on the strongest skeptical challenge and then proceeds to reject whatever is open to the slightest doubt. He continues until he has found something certain that can withstand the skeptical challenge.</p>

<h3 id="skeptical-arguments-rejected">Skeptical Arguments Rejected</h3>

<h4 id="argument-1">Argument 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>If I am occasionally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs, then it is possible that I am totally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs.</li>
  <li>I am occasionally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs.</li>
  <li>Thus it is possible that I am totally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs.</li>
  <li>If I don’t know that I am totally mistaken in my perceptual beliefs, then I don’t know that O (where O is a proposition about perceptual objects).</li>
  <li>I don’t know that O.</li>
</ol>

<p>This argument is valid, but Descartes thinks there is a problem with premise 2. While 2 is true about some beliefs, it is not true about all. I occasionally make mistakes about small and distant objects, but I’m never mistaken about medium sized objects in front of me in good lighting. Since Descartes is looking for an argument that could test all his beliefs, and this argument tests only some beliefs, he searches for a stronger skeptical argument.</p>

<h4 id="argument-2">Argument 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>If I don’t know that I’m not dreaming, then I don’t know that I have hands.</li>
  <li>I don’t know that I’m not dreaming.</li>
  <li>I don’t know that I have hands.</li>
</ol>

<p>This argument is valid, but Descartes thinks that the argument does not generalize to every belief he holds. For instance, it does not generalize to his belief in the existence of space, time, magnitude, simple qualities, and so on. So, Descartes searches for an even stronger argument.</p>

<h3 id="evil-demon-argument-argument">Evil Demon Argument Argument</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If I don’t know that I’m not being deceived by an Evil Demon, then I don’t know that p.</li>
  <li>I don’t know that I’m not being deceived by an Evil Demon.</li>
  <li>I don’t know that p.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a suitably strong enough challenge to test all Descartes’ beliefs, including his beliefs about space, time, etc. Remember, his goal is to throw out all his beliefs and only let back in those that he knows to be true. He will now proceed to search for those beliefs that he would know to be true even if this skeptical scenario obtained.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-thinking-therefore-i-exist">I am thinking, therefore I exist</h3>

<p>Descartes writes the following in the second Meditation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Descartes first claims, ‘I exist’. There is nothing the Evil Demon could do to deceive him about this belief, i.e., the very fact that the Evil Demon would be deceiving him, proves that he, himself, would exist. Knowing that he exists is a good beginning, but we believe we know more than that. In particular, we believe we know what kind of things we are. Descartes agrees. He reviews his former beliefs about what kind of thing he is with the hope of identifying which of these beliefs can also withstand the skeptical challenge.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Beliefs about his body</dt>
  <dd>He has a body, arms, face, and so on.</dd>
  <dt>Beliefs about his functions:</dt>
  <dd>He takes nourishment, moves, senses, and thinks.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Many of these beliefs can be doubted. An evil demon could trick him into thinking he has a body when in fact he does not. An evil demon could trick him into thinking that he really moves when in fact he does not. But Descartes thinks that some beliefs cannot be doubted. Namely, he cannot doubt that he is a being that thinks, i.e., the Evil Demon  could never deceive one into thinking that one doesn’t think, or into thinking that one thinks when one doesn’t, in fact, think. But what is thinking?</p>

<p>Descartes claims that thinking involves doubting, understanding, affirming, refusing to affirm, desiring, having mental images, being aware of what comes from senses (even if the senses are being deceived). Thus, Descartes claims that he knows that he exists, he thinks, and that he affirms, desires, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="substance-dualism-again">Substance Dualism Again</h2>

<p>Descartes’ “cogito” argument, “I think, therefore I exist”, convinces him that he can be absolutely certain that he exists and that he is “A thinking thing”, “a thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines and has sensory perceptions.” Since he knows he is a thinking being, he now asks whether this thinking being could be identical to a body, i.e., is it his body that is thinking or is his mind a separate substance from his body. He will argue that a thinking thing cannot be identical to a body and so will conclude that that the body and mind are distinct from one another. All of his arguments turn on identifying some feature that the mind has but the body does not. In general: To show that X ≠ Y, all we need do is find a single property P such that X has P but Y lacks it, or Y has P but X lacks it. Such a property P can be called a differential property for X and Y.</p>

<h4 id="argument-1-1">Argument 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>I am such that my existence cannot be doubted.</li>
  <li>My body is not such that its existence cannot be doubted.</li>
  <li>Therefore, I am not identical with my body.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the thinking thing that I am, that is, my mind, is not identical with my body.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="argument-2-1">Argument 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>My mind is transparent to me—that is, nothing can be in my mind without my knowing that it is there.</li>
  <li>My body is not transparent to me in the same way.</li>
  <li>Therefore, my mind is not identical with my body.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="argument-3">Argument 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Each mind is such that there is a unique subject who has direct access to its contents.</li>
  <li>No material body has a specially privileged knower—knowledge of material things is in principle public and intersubjective.</li>
  <li>Therefore, minds are not identical with material bodies.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are said to know something ‘‘directly’’ when the knowledge is not based on evidence, or inferred from other things we know. When knowledge is direct, like my knowledge of my toothache, it makes no sense to ask, “How do you know?”</p>

<h4 id="argument-4">Argument 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>My essential nature is to be a thinking thing.</li>
  <li>My body’s essential nature is to be an extended thing in space.</li>
  <li>My essential nature does not include being an extended thing in space.</li>
  <li>Therefore, I am not identical with my body. And since I am a thinking thing (namely a mind), my mind is not identical with my body</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="argument-5">Argument 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>If anything is material, it is essentially material.</li>
  <li>However, I am possibly immaterial—that is, there is a possible world in which I exist without a body.</li>
  <li>Hence, I am not essentially material.</li>
  <li>Hence, it follows (with the first premise) that I am not material.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="argument-6">Argument 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Suppose I am identical with this body of mine.</li>
  <li>In 2001 this body did not exist.</li>
  <li>Hence, from the first premise, it follows that I did not exist in 2001.</li>
  <li>But I existed in 2001.</li>
  <li>Hence, a contradiction, and the supposition must be false.</li>
  <li>Hence, I am not identical with my body.”</li>
</ol>

  <p>Should the soul of a prince, carrying with it the consciousness of the prince’s past life, enter and inform the body of a cobbler, as soon as deserted by his own soul, everyone sees he would be the same person with the prince, accountable only for the prince’s action…. Had I the same consciousness “that I saw the ark and Noah’s flood, as that I saw an overflowing of the Thames last winter, or as that I write now, I could no more doubt that I who write this now, that saw the Thames overflowed last winter, that viewed the flood at the general deluge, was the same self … than that I who write this am the same myself now whilst I write … that I was yesterday.

<h2 id="problems-with-substance-dualism">Problems with Substance Dualism</h2>

<h3 id="problems-with-the-cogito">Problems with the Cogito</h3>

<p>There are several problems with the Cogito, Descartes’ main argument that shows he exists and is a thinking being. The most pressing is a concern about whether the argument assumes what it seeks to prove. Recall that Descartes argues, ‘I am thinking, therefore I exist’.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am thinking.</li>
  <li>Therefore, I exist.</li>
</ol>

<p>The premise, ‘I am thinking’ seems to presupposes that the subject of the thought exists. Since the subject of the thought is ‘I’, the premise then assumes the conclusion, i.e., it assumes that I exist. An argument that assumes what it is trying to prove is obviously circular. And recall that Descartes is supposed to be testing whether he can doubt his own existence. He is begging the question if he argues, ‘I exist, therefore I cannot doubt that I exist.’</p>

<p>We might try save Descartes by reformulating the argument in a non-question begging way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a thought</li>
  <li>Therefore,  I exist</li>
</ol>

<p>The Evil Demon certainly cannot deceive us about whether there is thought. This argument also avoids begging the question in the way the argument above does. However, the argument is invalid. We  cannot infer from the fact that there is someone doing P, that we are that person  doing P. Compare:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is swimming.</li>
  <li>Therefore, I am swimming.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can infer that someone is <em>swimming</em> from the first premise, but we cannot infer that we are the person doing the swimming. Similarly, even if we can infer from the fact that a thought  exists that <em>someone</em> is thinking, we cannot infer that we are the ones thinking that thought.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-causal-interaction">Problems with Causal Interaction</h3>

<p>Descartes claimed that the mind and body causally influence one another. Our decision to throw the ball causes our limbs to move. The cat biting our finger causes our mind to feel pain. But how does this mental causation work? Think of an easy case of causation, say the movement of a pool ball as it is struck by another. One pool ball brings about an effect in another pool ball by, in part, touching it. Does all causation involve contact? Contact requires surfaces, so if causation involves contact, how could the mind, which doesn’t have a surface, touch the body which does have a surface? Descartes explains in his 6th Meditation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mind is not immediately affected by all parts of the body, but only by the brain, or perhaps just by one small part of the brain…. Every time this part of the brain is in a given state, it presents the same signals to the mind, even though the other parts of the body maybe in a different condition at the time…. For example, when the nerves in the foot are set in motion in a violent and unusual manner, this motion, by way of the spinal cord, reaches the inner parts of the brain, and there gives the mind its signal for having a certain sensation, namely the sensation of a pain as occurring in the foot. This stimulates the mind to do its best to get rid of the cause of the pain, which it takes to be harmful to the foot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Descartes identifies the pineal gland as the seat of the soul, as that place where the soul and mind directly interact. He thinks there are bodily fluids in the nerves. He thinks that the gland causes the fluid to move in an appropriate way to transmit the required motion to the rest of the body.</p>

<p>But Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia challenged Descartes to explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how the mind of a human being, being only a thinking substance, can determine the bodily spirits in producing bodily actions. For it appears that all determination of movement is produced by the pushing of the thing being moved, by the manner in which it is pushed by that which moves it, or else by the qualification and figure of the surface of the latter. Contact is required for the first two conditions, and extension for the third. [But] you entirely exclude the latter from the notion you have of the soul, and the former seems incompatible with an immaterial thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the argument presented more formally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1. For anything to cause a physical object to move, or cause any change in one, there must be a transfer of momentum from the cause to the physical object.</li>
  <li>P2. If an object imparts momentum to another, it must have mass and velocity.</li>
  <li>P3. An unextended mind outside physical space has neither mass nor velocity.</li>
  <li>C. Therefore, an unextended mind cannot cause a physical body to move.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="varieties-of-dualism">Varieties of Dualism</h2>
<p>Recall that Descartes thinks that the mind and body are discrete substances, they are each the subjects of various features and are not themselves features of anything else. On this view, we really do have minds. It is, if you like, a separate thing in itself with its own nature.</p>

<p>While substance dualism receives little current support, a different form of dualism has, namely, property dualism. Consider the properties of being a bachelor and being an unmarried man. These are one and the same property. How about the property of having a shape and having a size? These are obviously distinct properties that co-occur together. Anything which has a shape has a size and vice versa.</p>

<p>Descartes believed that the mind is something that has properties, but many today think that the mind is better characterized as properties had by some substance, in particular, properties had by the physical body we possess. Consider the mental property of ‘being in a state of pain’, or the activity like ‘thinking about Descartes’. These are properties, understood broadly, that are instantiated some substance, e.g., the brain. Whenever these properties occur in the brain, there is some other feature/property that occurs in the brain, i.e., some c-fibre fires when you experience pain.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between these physical and mental properties? Are they identical just like how the properties bachelor and being a nunmarried man are identical? Or are they distinct like the properties shape and size are distinct?</p>

<p>Many of those who deny that the mind is a real thing still argue that mental properties and physical properties are distinct, that a C-fibre firing and the feeling of pain are numerically distinct (even if they always occur together). Others deny this. They deny that there are any non-physical properties at all. So even if thought substance dualism is no longer in favor, the question about whether the mind and body are still somehow distinct is very much a live one.</p>
