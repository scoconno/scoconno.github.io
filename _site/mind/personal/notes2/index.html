  <h1 class="page-title">Psychological Continuity</h1>
  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Recall that our question is what personal identity consists in. We have already discussed two theories:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Same Body Theory:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if the body of A is identical to the body of B.</dd>
  <dt>Same Soul Theory:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a
later time if and only if the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this section, we will be focused on a third and radically different theory:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Psychological Continuity Theory:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if B is psychologically continuous with A.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="further-clarification-of-our-question">Further Clarification of our Question</h2>
<p>In order to introduce our new theory, we need to think again about the question that we are trying to answer–what does personal identity consist in? Our first two answers said that there was some one thing that each of the earlier and later stages of a person share, this one thing is numerically identical between each stage, whether it be soul or body. Our third view suggests that we do not need some one identical to each stage, rather we need each of those stages to enjoy a certain <em>relationship</em> to one another.</p>

<p>Consider the following image of a train:</p>

<p><img src="stages.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Appropriate Connection: Example <img src="train.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Look at the engine. Look at the final carriage. Are you looking at one and the same train? In one important way, the trains you are looking at are numerically identical. They clearly aren’t numerically distinct trains; the owner of that train you attend to when watching the engine is identical to the owner of the train you are attending to when you watching the final carriage.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, we ask in virtue of what is the engine and final carriage numerically identical trains? I think we would all agree that identity of the train cars is not explained by any one identical feature intrinsic to each, e.g., they aren’t identical because there is a name on one identical to the name on the other. The various train care are one and the same train by virtue of the fact that they are connected to one another—just notice the locks where each car connects with one another.</p>

<p>When I claim that the cars are the same by virtue of being appropriately connected, I have subtly changed the focus of our initial investigation. The invdividual train cars are not numerically identical to one another; the engine is not identical to the coal car. And if by ‘same train’, I mean ‘train car’, the various trains cars are not numerically identical cars. But I don’t mean this when asking whether the cars are identical. What I mean to ask is whether the trains composed by each car is numerically identical; is the train that the engine is part of numerically identical to the train that the final carriage is part of. Likewise, I can ask whether the body that a certain hand is part of is numerically identical to the body that some other hand is part of.</p>

<p>Asked in this way, what we would like to know is whether the train cars compose one and the same train, are they parts of the same train. To answer this question, we must decide whether the carraiges are approrpiately related to compose a whole train.</p>

<h2 id="psychological-continuity--version-1">Psychological Continuity–Version 1</h2>

<p>Locke quote</p>

<p>Defenders of our third theory of personal identity claim that you are you identical to your earlier self by you and that earlier self composing one and the same person. Your bodies are numerically distinct. Your personality could have subtly changed. But what’s important is that the various different stages compose one and the same person.</p>

<p>Just as some connection between the train cars explained why the compose some one train, so too there must be some connection between person stage if they are to compose some one person. What is that connection?</p>

<p>A simple proposal explains this connection in terms of memory:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Memory Continuity:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if B <em>remembers</em> the <em>experiences</em> that A has.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This proposal seems plausible once we reflect a moment on a difference between two types of memories. First, there are <em>factual memories</em>. These are memories that that a particular event occurred. They can be shared by several people, e.g., many remember President Obama’s inauguration in 2008, many remember President Obama handing over the reigns of power to President Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Factual memories, memories that many can share, differ from <em>personal memories</em>. These are the memories of experiencing the event itself. Such memories cannot be shared as personal experiences, are, well, personal. For example, only President Obama has the personal memory of <em>being inaugurated</em> at his 2008 inauguration. Only he knows what it was like for <em>him</em> to be inaugurated (even though many (factually) remember that he was inaugurated). Similarly, only President Obama can have a personal memory of handing over the reigns of power to President Trump (although many have the factual memory of that same event).</p>

<ul>
  <li>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if B is psychologically continuous with A.</li>
</ul>

<p>Psychological Continuity: There is a chain of person-stages connected by episodic memory.</p>

<p><img src="letters.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>F remembers what E experienced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>E remembers what D experienced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>D remembers what C experienced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C remembers what B experienced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B remembers what A experienced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, A, B, C, D, E, and F are psychologically continuous with each
other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence, they are all stages of the one very same person.</p>
  </li>

<p>Problem: Apparent vs Real Memory <img src="fake.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I really remember X iff</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have an experience as though I remember experiencing X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did experience X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I apparently remember X iff</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have an experience as though I remember experiencing X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not experience X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 1</p>

<p><img src="seat.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Internal Differences</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If I could perceive a qualitative difference between a real and an
apparent memory of X, then this qualitative difference would
distinguish the real and apparent memory of X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can perceive no qualitative difference between a real and an
apparent memory of X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No qualitative difference distinguishes real and apparent memories
of X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 2</p>

<p>Suggestion: If two persons A and B both have an experience as though
they remember the experiences of some person P, then the memory of A (or
B) is real and not apparent only if A (or B) is identical to P.</p>

<p>The problems is that it is circular to make both claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A = P only if A really remembers what P experiences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A really remembers what P experiences only if A = P.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Circular Reasoning</p>

<p><img src="circularity.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 3</p>

<p>Suggestion</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A real memory is one that was caused in the right way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An apparent memory is one that was not caused in the right way, e.g.
hypnosis, implantation, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problem-Duplicates!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two persons A and B both have memories of what P experienced that
were caused in the right way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A $\neq$ B.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having memories caused in the right way is not sufficient for
personal identity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
