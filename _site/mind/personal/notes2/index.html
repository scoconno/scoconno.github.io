  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Recall that our question is what personal identity consists in. We have already discussed two theories:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Same Body Theory:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if the body of A is identical to the body of B.</dd>
  <dt>Same Soul Theory:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a
later time if and only if the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In these notes, we will be focused on a third and radically different theory:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Psychological Continuity Theory:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if B is psychologically continuous with A.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="further-clarification-of-our-question">Further Clarification of our Question</h2>
<p>In order to introduce our new theory, we need to think again about the question that we are trying to answer–what does personal identity consist in? Our first two answers said that there was some one thing that each of the earlier and later stages of a person share, this one thing is numerically identical between each stage, whether it be soul or body. Our third view suggests that we do not need some one identical thing shared by each stage, rather we need each of those stages to enjoy a certain <em>relationship</em> to one another. Look again at our picture representing personal identity:</p>

<p><img src="stages.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Our first two theories stated that there will be some thing, either a soul or body, that is shared by each stage. This common thing shared will exist fully at each moment that the person exists. If, for instance, personal identity consists in sameness of soul, then the one same soul will exist fully at each moment that the person exists. Our third theory advises against looking for one same thing that exists fully at each moment that the person exists. Rather, it claims that we should look at the relationship between all the stages of the person. Consider the following image of a train:</p>

<p>Appropriate Connection: Example <img src="train.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Look at the engine. Look at the final carriage. Are you looking at one and the same train? They clearly aren’t numerically distinct trains; the owner of that train you attend to when watching the engine is identical to the owner of the train you are attending to when you watching the final carriage. Suppose, now, we ask in virtue of what is the engine and final carriage numerically identical trains? I think we would all agree that identity of the train cars is not explained by any one identical feature intrinsic to each. The various train car are one and the same train by virtue of the fact that they are connected to one another—just notice the locks where each car connects with one another.</p>

<p>When I claim that the cars are the same by virtue of being appropriately connected, I have subtly changed the focus of our initial investigation. The invdividual train cars are not numerically identical to one another; the engine is not identical to the coal car. And if by ‘same train’, I mean ‘train car’, the various trains cars are not numerically identical cars. But I don’t mean this when asking whether the cars are identical. What I mean to ask is whether the train that the engine is part of is numerically identical to the train that the final carriage is part of. Likewise, I can ask whether the body that has my left hand is part is is numerically identical to the body that my right has part; I am not ask whether my left and right hand are identical to one another. I am asking whether they parts of one and the same way.</p>

<p>Asked in this way, what we would like to know is whether the train cars compose one and the same train, are they parts of the same train. To answer this question, we must decide whether the carraiges are approrpiately related to compose a whole train. Likewise, instead of asking in virtue of what the various stages of person’s life are identical to one another, we can in virtue of what all these stages compose one and the same person; the baby and the teenager are, on this view, numerically distinct person stages, but person stages that compose one and the same person that weaves its way through time.</p>

<h2 id="psychological-continuity--version-1">Psychological Continuity–Version 1</h2>

<p>In his ‘Essay on Human Understanding’ John Locke articulated our third theory of personal identity, and perhaps was the first person to do so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For as far as any intelligent Being can repeat the Idea of any past Action with the same consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same consciousness it has of any present Action; so far it is the same personal Self.” John Locke (§10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Locke believes that you are you identical to your earlier self by you and that earlier self composing one and the same person. Your bodies are numerically distinct. Your personality could have subtly changed. But what’s important is that the various different stages of compose one and the same person. Just as some connection between the train cars explained why the compose some one train, so too there must be some connection between person stage if they are to compose some one person. According to Locke, that connection was memory. A simple version of his proposal is as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Memory Continuity:</dt>
  <dd>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if B <em>remembers</em> the <em>experiences</em> that A has.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This proposal seems plausible given the difference between two types of memories. First, there are <em>factual memories</em>. These are memories that some event occurred. They can be shared by several people, e.g., many remember President Obama’s inauguration in 2008, many remember President Obama handing over the reigns of power to President Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Factual memories, memories that many can share, differ from <em>personal memories</em>. These are the memories of experiencing the event itself. Such memories cannot be shared since personal experiences, are, well, personal. For example, only President Obama has the personal memory of <em>being inaugurated</em> at his 2008 inauguration. Only he knows what it was like for <em>him</em> to be inaugurated (even though many (factually) remember that he was inaugurated). Similarly, only President Obama can have a personal memory of handing over the reigns of power to President Trump (although many have the factual memory of that same event).</p>

<p><img src="leo.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So consider the imagine of Leonardo Di Caprio. Locke proposed that the famous actor is identical to that young boy because he had personal memories of what that boy experienced. If, for instance, the younger spilled a drink during his first audition, only the adult Leo has the personal memory of the younger Leo’s experiences. Of course, many others could have a factual memory of that event. But only the adult Leo remembers what it was like to be that younger Leo experiencing that event.</p>

<h3 id="objections-to-version-1">Objections to Version 1</h3>

<p>While version 1 seems plausible, it is not adequate as an explanation of personal identity. Allow ‘Leonardo’ to be the 12 year old who will grow up to be the adult actor we all know. We will use the name ‘Leo’ to refer to the adult.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leo = Leonardo if and only if Leo remembers everything that Leonardo experenced.</li>
  <li>Leo does not remember what Leonardo ate for breakfast on the second day after his 12th birthday, though Leonardo certainly had the experience of eating something</li>
  <li>Riker $\neq$ Rike</li>
</ol>

<p>Our first premise is an application of the first version of our third theory, which states that a person existing at one time is identical to existing at some earlier time just if the later person remembers all the earlier person’s experiences. So, if the younger person ate a cake, the older person is identical to them only if they remember the experience of eating that cake.</p>

<p>Our second premise is trivial. Can you remember every experience you ever had? I cannot! I remember important life events, some embarrasing ones, special moments with friends and family, etc. But I certainly do not remember what I ate for lunch, on say, June 11th, 1995. No idea!</p>

<p>3 states our conclusion. Since Leo does not remember Leonardo’s experience of eatng that birthday cake, Leo is not ientical to Leonardo. It should be fairly obvious to you why this simple version of our third theory fails. It is far too demanding. It requires you to have complete and perfect memory, and while a few lucky individual might have such a facility, the majaority of us do not. And even though you may have forgotten what you ate on your 12th birthday, surely you are still identical to your 12 year old self.</p>

<h2 id="version-2">Version 2</h2>

<p>While our first version was implausible, it can be fixed. A more sophisticated version of our third theory states the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if B is psychologically continuous with A.</li>
</ul>

<p>By ‘psychological continuity’, we mean that there is a chain of person-stages connected by episodic memory. What does this mean? The idea is that it is not required for you to remember what you ate on your 12th birthday to be identical to your earlier self, all that is required is that you remember some earlier self, say, your 15 your old self, and that 15 year old self remembers eating the cake on your 12th birthday. Consider again our picture depicting personal identity and allow us give letters to each of the personal stages.</p>

<p><img src="letters.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>F, our oldest stage, remembers what the slightly younger stage, E, experienced. Now, F does not remember what an even younger stage, D, experienced, but E does remember D’s experiences. So, on our sophisticated version of the theory, F is identical to D, not by remember D’s experiences, but by remembering E’s experiences who in turn remembers D’s experiences. The chain can continue backward as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>F remembers what E experienced.</li>
  <li>E remembers what D experienced.</li>
  <li>D remembers what C experienced.</li>
  <li>C remembers what B experienced.</li>
  <li>B remembers what A experienced.</li>
  <li>Thus, A, B, C, D, E, and F are psychologically continuous with each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, F may not remember what A experienced, but F is connected to A via a chain of person stages that remembers what the immediately preceding stages experience. Hence, F is identical to A.</p>

<p>Version 2 obviously is immune to our objection to Version 1. That objection attacked the claim that later stages must remember every experience of every early stage all those stages to compose one and the same person. That was unrealistic. But version 2 does not require that the older stages remember every experience of every earlier stage. It requires only that there me an appropriate chain as described above.</p>

<h2 id="objections-to-version-2">Objections to Version 2</h2>

<p>River Objection <img src="river.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Problem: Apparent vs Real Memory <img src="fake.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I really remember X iff</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have an experience as though I remember experiencing X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did experience X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I apparently remember X iff</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have an experience as though I remember experiencing X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not experience X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 1</p>

<p><img src="seat.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Internal Differences</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If I could perceive a qualitative difference between a real and an
apparent memory of X, then this qualitative difference would
distinguish the real and apparent memory of X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can perceive no qualitative difference between a real and an
apparent memory of X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No qualitative difference distinguishes real and apparent memories
of X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 2</p>

<p>Suggestion: If two persons A and B both have an experience as though
they remember the experiences of some person P, then the memory of A (or
B) is real and not apparent only if A (or B) is identical to P.</p>

<p>The problems is that it is circular to make both claims:</p>

<p>Distinguishing Real vs. Apparent Memories: Attempt 3</p>

<p>Suggestion</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A real memory is one that was caused in the right way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An apparent memory is one that was not caused in the right way, e.g.
hypnosis, implantation, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problem-Duplicates!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two persons A and B both have memories of what P experienced that
were caused in the right way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A $\neq$ B.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having memories caused in the right way is not sufficient for
personal identity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
