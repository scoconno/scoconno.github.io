  <p>Personal Identity
Compare a picture of you taken yesterday to a picture taken of you just after birth. Are the people depicted in the photographs the same person? They certainly seem different.</p>

<ul>
  <li>human undergo complete cellular replacement every severn years.</li>
  <li>you could put the life after death thing here. Questions about reincarnation. A person claims to have memories of incidents long time ago. Are they the same person as that from years ago?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-the-question">Understanding the Question</h2>

<p>English can mislead us when trying to answer these questions. The words <code>identity', </code>identical’, `similar’, and ‘same’ are ambiguous; they can be used to describe different relations. And whenever a word can be used in several ways, we need to disambiguate those uses to answer questions that contain them. If a person told you they left their car near the bank, they could mean they left it near the money bank or the river bank. It’s obviously important to identify which one they mean.</p>

<p>`Same’ (and our other words) can also be used in different ways. On the one hand, it can be used to speak about qualitative similarity. Qualitative similarity is something that numerically distinct objects enjoy by sharing similar features. Two chairs are qualitatively similar in virtue of having similar shapes, sizes, and function. But they are still two chairs; if you buy both, you will have to pay twice the cost of one.</p>

<p>We can also use these words to talk about what is called numerical identity, the relation that each thing holds to itself and nothing else. Clark Kent and Superman are numerically identical. `Numerical identity’ is used when we want to say that there is just one entity to be counted. Suppose you know that Superman and Clark Kent were in the room. You would make a mistake if you counted them as two people; there is just one person there.</p>

<p>Humans obviously change their qualities over time. You and the baby you grew from share few, if any, features. You may have the same color eyes, but you are different sizes, different weight, made of different cells, different hair lengths, different tastes and dispositions. Nevertheless, you and that baby are numerically identical.</p>

<p>It is important that you and that baby are numerically identical. Numerical identity undergirds many of our moral and social institutions. The social security number assigned to that baby belongs to whoever is numerically identical to her. Being only qualitatively similar does not suffice. That would mean a twin could get that baby’s social security. The prison sentence delivered to a defendant should only be served by prisoners identical to that defendant. Suppose a prisoner is in the 10th year of a prison sentence for a crime committed by a person that they are only qualitatively similar to. What an injustice that would be! They would be serving a sentence for a crime that they did not commit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless that prisoner might be very different from the defendant. They may have had a religious conversion, changed their body shape, etc. Allow ‘P’ stand for a person existing now. And ‘Q’ stand for the person depicted the baby. You can use your own variable is you like. P is numerically identical to Q.</p>

<p>It is also important for answering questions of survival after death. In the dialog assigned for this week, there are three participants, Gretchen Weirob, a philosophy professor,  Sam Miller, a chaplain and longtime friend of Gretchen’s, and Dave Cohen, a former student of Gretchen’s. Gretchen, who is dying in the hospital, challenges Sam, a chaplain and religious believer, to prove to her that survival after the death of the body is possible. If Sam can do that, Gretchen says that she will be comforted. Sam and Dave consider various arguments for thinking that persons can survive the death of the body, but Gretchen remains unconvinced.</p>

<p>Don’t get distracted by the word ‘possible’ in our question, is survival possible? We are not asking whether such survival is likely. We are not even asking whether such survival is compatible with the laws of physics. We are asking whether surviving without a body is compatible with the nature of personhood. For instance, if we are essentially enmattered creatures, then we obviously could never survive without our bodies; the reason we cannot lies then in what it is to be a person.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-numerical-identity">What is Numerical Identity?</h2>

<p>In order to answer our question about what personal identity consists in, we need to discuss in more detail what numerical identity is. What are its features? What evidence is there that an identity holds? What evidence is there that an identity does not hold?</p>

<p>Numerical identity is a relation everything bears to itself and nothing else. It has three important features. It is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive. I will speak of each in turn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A relation R is <strong>reflexive</strong> if and only if everything bears R to itself.
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: everything is the same height as itself. The same height is a reflexive relation.</li>
      <li>Example 2: <em>being shorter than</em> is not a reflexive relation. Ted cannot be shorter than himself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A relation R is <strong>symmetric</strong> if and only if, if x is related by R to y, then y is related by R to x.
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: if Susan is a sibling of Sarah, then Sarah is <em>a sibling of</em> Susan. <em>Being a sibling of</em> is a symmetrical relation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A relation R is <strong>transitive</strong> if and only if, if x is related by R to y, and y is related by R to z, then x is related by R to z.
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: if Susan is shorter than Sarah, and Sarah is shorter than Hannah, then Susan is shorter than Hannah. <strong>Shorter than</strong> is a transitive relation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing these three features of numerical identity allows us to characterize more clearly why personal identity is so puzzling.  Allow ‘=’ for ‘numerically identical to’</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Riker = Thomas.</li>
  <li>Riker = William.</li>
  <li>Thomas = William…(by transitivity of identity)</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of 1-3 seems plausible. If we ignore William for a moment, none of us would doubt 1, that Thomas is identical to Riker, to the man who beamed down to the plant several years ago. If we ignore Thomas for a moment, none of us would doubt 2, that William is identical to Riker. But given the transitive of identity, if 1 and 2 are true, then 3 too must be true. Thomas and William must also be identical to one another. This is clearly false, as is easy to demonstrate with the following simple example. In the episode, Councilor Troy kissed Thomas on the holodeck. If Thomas = William, then Troy also kissed William on the holodeck. But William was in a different part of the ship altogether when the kiss occurred, so it is impossible that Troy kissed him when she kissed Thomas. We can add to these many more examples. Suppose that William committs a crime, suppose he steals a ship. Well, if William is identical to Thomas, Thomas too stole the ship. Thomas then is liable for the theft as William; but this is clearly absurd. The two men can be in different places at the same time, they can perform different actions at the same time, they could even get into a fight at the same time. They are not numerically identical.</p>

<p>Consider now the question whether we survive our bodily death. Gretchen, G, our sick philosopher, survives if and only if there is some person F at a time after her body has died such that G is identical to F. F can’t be merely similar to G. F cannot be a mere semblance of G, e.g., living on in the hearts and minds of her friends is no way for Gretchen to survive her bodily death. That is not the same as there being a person after the demise of her body who is she numerically identical to.</p>

<p>Remember! Qualitative similarity <em>vs.</em> numerical identity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two ginger bread men made by the same cookie cutter are qualitatively similar in several respects, e.g., they have the same shape, the same weight, the same colour, smell, and so on. But these are <em>two</em> numerically distinct entities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superman and Clark Kent are numerically identical, i.e., they are one and the same entity. If you want to count the number of entities in the room, you should only count Superman and Clark Kent once: Louis Lane makes a mistake when she counts them as two.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-personal-identity-consist-in">What does personal identity consist in?</h2>

<p>Despite their qualitative differences, what is it about P that makes her the very same person as Q? Three main answers have been defeneded: personal identity consists in sameness of body, sameness of soul, and psychological continuity. While each view has some virtues, each is problematic and there is currently no consensus on how to explain what makes you today identical to the person you grew up from.</p>

<p>Our first view, the sameness of body view, says the following:</p>

<p><img src="body.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="rikerb.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time if and only if the body of A is identical to the body of B.</li>
</ul>

<p>One clear upshot of this view is that we cannot survive our bodily death. We survive our bodily death only if there exists a person some time after the body has died who has the body. But this is impossible if the body died.</p>

<p>An obvious virtue of this view is that it explain how we are able to keep track and re-identify humans over time. We can perceive bodies. So, by perceiving bodies we should be able to keep track of them over time.</p>

<h2 id="objections">Objections</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Body swaps!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="freaky.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>But the problems are dramatic. On the one hand, it requires that the body of A is identical to the body of B. This then pushes the question back a step further. Despite the qualitative differences between these bodies what is it that ensures their numerical identity? No cell survives. Appearances change. DNA can be shared.</p>

<p>Perhaps a deeper problem lies in the fact that our concept of personal identity allows for the admittedly bizarre examples of swaps as described in movies like ‘Freak Friday’ in which a young daughter and her mother change bodies. We’ll never live to see such a strange case. It may be practically impossible for scientists to transfer one person to the another. But what is important about the example is that we have no conceptual difficulty in allowing that the person has swapped bodies. Our concept of personal identity is not strained by the movie. It was easy to imagine the people in different bodies. This shows something problematic.</p>

<h3 id="sameness-of-soul">Sameness of Soul</h3>

<p><img src="soul.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Our second theory may seem familiar. It states the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time iff the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="rikersoul.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>What is the soul?</p>

<p>Immaterial</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bodies are extended in 3-dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Souls have no extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are simple bodies—the basic bits of matter—and complex bodies
composed of matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Souls are neither simple or complex bodies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Seat of consciousness</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For any thought and experience, there must be some entity which does
the thinking and experiencing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Souls and not bodies are what think and experience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="cube.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The Seat of Consciousness <img src="seat.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Belief in the existence of souls is commonplace in different religions both today and in history. There are, of course, different views about what souls are. Here I will outline a view of what souls that would allow them play a role in explaining personal identity.</p>

<p>Body and soul are radically different.  Bodies are extended in 3-dimensions. Souls have no extension. There are simple bodies—-the basic bits of matter—-and complex bodies composed of matter. But souls are neither simple or complex bodies.</p>

<p>Souls are viewed as the seat of consciousness. For any thought and experience, there must be some entity which does the thinking and experiencing. Souls and not bodies are what think and experience.</p>

<h2 id="objections-1">Objections</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A person A at one time is identical to a person B at a later time   iff the soul of A is identical to the soul of B.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is there for this claim?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could we know that the soul of A is identical to the soul of B?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Direct experience?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Indirect experience: Same Body</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Indirect experience: Same Psychology</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Indirect Experience 1 Claim</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Same body entails same soul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We directly perceive bodies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We indirectly perceive souls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problems</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If we can know that B is true, then B can be known either <em>a posteriori</em> or <em>a priori</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B cannot be known <em>a posteriori</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B cannot be known <em>a priori</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we cannot know that B is true.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Discussion of P2 <img src="apost.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With the chocolate, I can test. My test involves me perceiving both the chocolate and the inside. We keep checking and we come to know that certain wrapper is associated with certain filling. But we can’t check whether souls are associated with bodies.</p>

<p>Indirect Experience 2 Claim</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Same psychology entail same soul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can directly know that the psychology of A is the same as the psychology of B.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we can indirectly know that the soul of A is the same as the soul of B.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problems</p>

<ol>
  <li>If same psychology entailed same soul, then exemplification of psychological traits would be infallible evidence for sameness of soul.</li>
  <li>Exemplification of psychological traits are not infallible evidence for sameness of soul.</li>
  <li>Same psychology does not entail same soul.</li>
</ol>

<p>Fallible vs. Infallible Evidence for Personal Identity</p>

<p><img src="twins.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Consider a scenario in which 1) a series of souls flow into and out of the same body, and 2) that same body exhibits the same psychological traits. If personal identity consists in sameness of soul, then there is a numerically distinct person every time a soul is exchanged. However, with every soul exchange there is no corresponding change in psychological traits. Thus, same psychology does not entail same soul.</p>
