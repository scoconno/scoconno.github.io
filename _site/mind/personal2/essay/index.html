  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Such gall! Your so-called friend, Sam, borrowed fifty dollars from you over six months ago and is refusing to repay. He was in a bind, so you were happy to help. But he is now flush and needs to make you whole. Yet, in true Sam fashion, he has a philosophical argument that he claims shows that he owes you nothing. According to him, the person who borrowed money from you 6 months ago is not the person you call Sam today. The hair lengths are different. The skin of today’s Sam is sunburnt, but the person who borrowed that money was not sunburnt. Today’s Sam is also fit, healthy, happy, and employed. The person who borrowed from you is none of these things.</p>

<p>Arguing with Sam in person never gets you anywhere. An email is best. In your email, you examine his argument and try prove that the Sam from today is, in fact, the very man who borrowed that money from you six months ago. You explain to him the difference between numerical identity and qualitative similarity, and use the psychological continuity theory to show how the Sam from today is identical to that earlier borrower despite their qualitative differences.</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charitably explaining arguments for views that are not your own.</li>
  <li>Explaining difficult concepts in your own words.</li>
  <li>Understanding the difference between qualitative similarity and numerical identity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Write an email to Sam. In your email, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain the puzzle of personal identity. Why does Sam deny that he is identical to anyone from six months ago?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NB:</strong> Explain here the difference between qualitative similarity and numerical identity. Failure to do so will result in loss of points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solve this puzzle by using the psychological continuity theory.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NB:</strong> This assignment is not asking you to discuss each possible response to the puzzle. Only discuss the psychological continuity theory. Failure to ignore this instruction will result in a loss of points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include either of these elements in your email will result in a loss of points.</p>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.</p>
