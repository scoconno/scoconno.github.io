  <h3 id="behaviorism">Behaviorism</h3>

<p>The ones closest to us are often the ones we can read the best. I easily can judge when my wife’s thoughts are elsewhere, or my brother is troubling over his mortgage. I seem to know their minds. And they seem to know mine. If Descarte were right, then my loved ones minds are identical to their souls, immaterial and invisible entities. How then could I have knowledge of their minds? I can’t see their souls. But I often know what they are thinking and feeling without them telling me. How is this possible?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that mental state correlate with behavior and behavior is something that we can see. For our purposes, there are two types of behavior, physiological responses and bodily movements. Physiological responses are those automatic reactions to a stimulus, e.g., pupil dilation, sweating, etc. We are often unaware of many of these instinctive responses, e.g., flaring our nostrils, or grinding our teeth, etc. Sometimes we are aware of them and sometimes we can stop, but the point is tha we all experience various automatic physical changes to stimuli.</p>

<p>A bodily movement, on the other hand, is an observable motion of some or all parts of the body. These include extending and retracting your limbs. Turning your head from left to right, etc. The below picture depicts the range of bodily movements that are characteristic of our our species.</p>

<p>IMAGEE (in your email)</p>

<p>Our mental states seem correlated with our behaviors. Attending to behaviors seems to be how we judget what mental states others are in. A person in pain tends to wince and groan. A person that is excited tends to speak in a higher pitch and have dilated pupils. These correlations between mental states and behaviors, both physiological responses and bodily movements, are the basis of some signiificant discoveries and positions in modern psychology and philosophy of mind. The focus of this section is on one such position, namely, <em>behaviorism</em>.</p>

<p>The word <em>behaviorism</em> connotes a number of things and it will be important in what follows for us to isolate the philosophical position that goes by that name. But, setting aside the many intricacies and differences, behaviorists of all types approach the study of the mind via the study of behavior. For instance, a therapist who calls themselves a behaviorist will not plum the depths of their patient’s dreams and childhood memories. They are more likely to focus on problematic behaviors and their triggers. Therapy may consist in avoding the triggers or being densensitized to them, e.g., treating a phobia by densitizing the patient to whatever they fear. In both cases, the goal is really focused on changing the behavior. Likewise, animal psychologists who call themselves behaviorists study the minds of their favored animals via their behaviors. They learn how, say, a lion (my favorite), behaves when encountering a new situation. And, they assume that the relevant reaction is all we need focus on to learn about the mental states of that lion.</p>

<p>There are, though, different types of behaviorists, with some thinking that behaviors give clues to the mind while others thinking that behavior is all there is to the mind. Distinguish three versions of the view as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Methodological Behaviorism:</dt>
  <dd>Psychology is the science of behavior and of nothing other than behavior. This is a claim about about how to practice psychology. It says that (1) the job of the psychologists is to explain why organisms’ behave they way they do, and (2) the only legitimate explanations a psychologist can offer are observable stimuli. The idea is that if psychology is to be a science then it cannot concern itself with anything as murky as the inner working of the mind. A hypothesis that, for instance, a person feels pain when they stub their toe must be testable if the hypothesis is a scientific one. And it is testable says that methodological behaviorist only if the inputs and outputs are observable by many, i.e., only if the hypothesis is about observable behaviours and stimuli. An animal psychologist, on this view, cannot talk about what a lion feels or thinks. Feelings and thoughts are not observable, so they should be no concern of the scientist.</dd>
  <dt>Psychological Behaviorism:</dt>
  <dd>Psychology is a rich discipline that must explain many things and one of these things is behavior. Even if the methodological behaviorist is wrong, there are still questions to ask about why humans and animals behave as they do. Psychological behaviorists say that the sources of behavior are exteranal and not internal, that is the causes of our behavior are always environemntla causes and never internal, mental causess.</dd>
  <dt>Philosophical, Ontological, Logical, Analytical, Radical Behaviorism:</dt>
  <dd>Mental statues just are behavioral dispositions. This is the view that concerns us and it is unfortunate that is goes by so many names. The first two behaviorisms were not theories about mental states. The first was a theory about a legitimate psychological explanation. The second was a theory about the explanation for behavior. Both of these theories can be agnostic about mental states, about whether they exist and what they are. Our third theory is not like this. It is a theory about the nature and existence of the mind. Namely, it claims that mental states are identical to sets of behaviors or behavior dispositions. Such an identity may seem surprising. Just as Louise Lane was surprised to learn that Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same person, it would be surpising to learn that pain, for instance, just is identical to some grimaces and moans. But that’s what philosophical behaviorists believe. They do not think ther are any mental states inside that skull of yours—your mental states juat are all those external, observable behavior. To say that a person has a belief that, say, it will rain later, just means that the person is likely to behave a certain way, e.g., carry an umbrella, say aloud the words ‘it will rain’, etc. The belief is not something inside their skull at all.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Consider this example: “Paul has a toothache”. This sentence is about Paul’s pain. Initially, you may think that the pain is residing somewhere inside Paul. That the pain is the cause of his grimacing and moaning. But, the philosophical behaviorist denies this. They do not think that the pain is the cause that behavior. They think that the pain just is that behavior. And, so, they will claim that we can re-write the sentence in a way that speaks only about physiological responses and bodily movements. Here’s Kim’s proposed translation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds.</li>
  <li>At the question “What is the matter?” Paul utters the words, “I have a toothache.”</li>
  <li>Closer examination reveals a decayed tooth with exposed pulp.</li>
  <li>Paul’s blood pressure, digestive processes, the speed of his reactions, show such and such changes.</li>
  <li>Such and such processes occur in Paul’s central nervous system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that we have translated the sentence about pain so that we no longer refer to anything that is private.</p>

<h3 id="argument-for-behaviorism">Argument for Behaviorism</h3>

<p>This is Wittgenstein’s beetle in the box video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x86hLtOkou8</p>

<p>Philosophical behaviorism is a radical claim. Why accept it? Perhaps the best argument for the claim rests on some simple observations on the nature of language, on how it is that we can communicate with each other. Whatever else it may do, language is means of communication, a means of directing other peoples’ attention, a means of getting them to do something, a means of getting them to believe something, etc. How we use language to do all this is a rich area of study that we could devote several semesters to. All we need observe here is that language can only be used a means of communication if the meanings of our phrases are publicly accessible. I can only succeed in directing your attention to the tiger with the word ‘tiger’ if we both agree upon what the word ‘tiger’ means. If you think it means a small plant with stripes, then I’ll hardly succeed in ensuring you attend to the large mammal running at us when I say, ‘look at that tiger!’. Spoken language is no different here than other forms of communication. Sign language too only can be used to communicate if we agree on which shapes mean what. Morse code can also be used to communicate if we agree upon which sequences of dots means what. We don’t need to consider such complicated instrument. Just think of traffic lights. They work only because we agree and know that a green light indicates you are free to travel while a red indicates you must stop. Language too works only if we agree and know what the various words we use mean and stand for.</p>

<p>If mental states exist and we can talk about them, then the words referring to mental states must be ones whose use we can agree upon. But mental states, if the exist, are by their nature accessible only to those that have them; they are not publically accessible. This is partly why the famous philosophyer Ludwig Wittgenstein argues that mental states do not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word “pain” means – must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?
Now someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case! –Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a “beetle”. No one can look into anyone else’s box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. –Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. –But suppose the word “beetle” had a use in these people’s language? –If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty. –No, one can ‘divide through’ by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.
That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of ‘object and designation’ the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant. (Wittgenstein, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Sec. 293)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very innovative example. But let me change it a little. Suppose each of you have a box. Each of you will use the word ‘baviga’ to describe what is in that box. Now, only you can see into that very special box. If anyone else tries to take a peak, the box will implode and the peekers will fail. But just as nobody else can look inside your box, you cannot look inside the box of anyone else either. Everyone, though, usese the word ‘baviga’ to talk about what is inside that box. They say things like, ‘I have such a terrible baviga today’, ‘the baviga is not as bad today as yesterday’, ‘I wonder what will happen with my baviga tomorrow’, etc. While each of you use the word ‘baviga’, how do you know that you are each using the word baviga to describe the same type of thing? How do you know that what we each have in our respective boxes is the same? We can’t! It’s possible that they are radically different types of things and so that I would never use the word baviga to describe what you are calling a baviga in your box. The problem is that the referent of the word ‘baviga’ is in principle accessible only to the person who uses the word; there is no possibiliyt of us all accessing the one object and callibrating our language to ensure that we are referring to the same entity with the word ‘baviga’.</p>

<p>You likely will agree that ‘baviga’ is a silly word that is useless for communication. If we can’t check that we are using it to mean the same thing, then it cannot be used for communication. What about all those words that seem to refer to mental states? Words like, ‘pain’, ‘belief’, ‘pleasure’, ‘itch’, ‘taste’, etc? Do you think that we can use those words to communicate with each other? If you do, then those words better not be like ‘baviga’. If we all use the word ‘pain’ to communicate, then the word should have the same meaning; it should refer to the same thing. But how do we know that when you say ‘I am in pain’ and I say ‘I am in pain’ that the word ‘pain’ in both sentences refers to the same thing? How do we know, in other words, that the thing I experience and call pain is anything like the thing you experience and call pain? If mental states are truly internal and private states, then we can never know this. We could be using the word to describe very different things altogether.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verificationists think something else.</li>
  <li>I need to talk about observational sentences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, we all use the word pain to refer to our subjective sensation, so much so that in the end we all agree on the meaning of pain even though everyone’s sensation of pain might differ. If it means the same for everyone, if it is a constant, this means it derives its meaning solely from its use in a social and public context and not from any relevance to the private sensation of pain. The private object beetle or the private sensation of pain, according to Wittgenstein, drop out of consideration. What is your response to this? How can we communicate private sensations and ideas if we only have access to a language that is meaningful from its public, not private, use?
+ I need to introduce general discussion of meaning.</p>

  <li>The meaning of a sentence is given by the conditions that must be verified to obtain if the sentence is true (we may call these “verification conditions”).</li>
  <li>If a sentence has a meaning that can be shared by different speakers, its verification conditions must be accessible to each speaker—that is, they must be publicly observable.</li>
  <li>Only behavioral and physical phenomena (including physiological occurrences) are publicly observable.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the sharable meaning of any psychological sentence must be specifiable by statements of publicly observable verification “conditions, that is, statements describing behavioral and physical conditions that must hold if the psychological statement is true.</li>

<h2 id="objections-to-behaviorism">Objections to Behaviorism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge of our own minds: The behaviorist explains our knowledge of other people’s mental states, but tells the wrong sort of story about how we know about our own mental states. We seem to have direct access to our own minds. We don’t need to observe our behavior to know how we’re feeling, especially qualitative states like pain and sensory experiences. Whether I’m in pain, or having the “reddish” kind of visual experience I normally have when I look at a ripe tomato, seems to a matter of what’s going on in me right now, which I can be directly aware of. It doesn’t seem to be a matter of how I would act in certain hypothetical situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some features of mentality have characteristic ‘qualia’ or presentationally immediate or phenomenal qualities. To be in pain, for example, is not merely to produce appropriate pain behavior under the right environmental circumstances, but it is to experience a ‘like-thisness’ to the pain (as something dull or sharp, perhaps). A purely behaviorist creature, a ‘zombie’, as it were, may engage in pain behavior, including beneath the skin pain responses, yet completely lack whatever is qualitatively distinctive of and proper to pain (its painfulness).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mental states do not cause anything. But we ordinarily think that behavior is caused by mental states. It is not the mental state itself. Behavior is only a sign or piece of evidence for what mental state you’re in–in the same way that smoke is only a sign that there is a fire. This is why we think it’s possible for someone  to be in pain without engaging in pain behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no distinctive behaviors associated with a single mental state in isolation. Any connection between mental states and behavior normally needs to invoke other mental states. It is difficult for the behaviorist to say what sorts of behavior one mental state will dispose a person towards, without making assumptions about what other mental states the person has.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider the behaviorist’s account of wanting a Caribbean vacation. X wants a Caribbean vacation iff:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>X is disposed to read the Caribbean brochures first, if you give him a bunch of holiday brochures–this assumes that X is not already <em>bored</em> of Caribbean brochures.</li>
  <li>X is disposed to pack his bags when you give him a ticket to Jamaica–this depends on whether he <em>believes</em> the flight will be canceled, whether he can afford to miss work, etc.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, just because you utter the sounds “I want to go to the Caribbean,” does that mean you want to go to the Caribbean? Perhaps you’re being deceptive. Or perhaps you didn’t even mean to be asserting anything: perhaps you made those noises as the result of a complicated hiccough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upshot of these observations seems to be that we can’t find any behavior described in purely physical terms which is associated with any mental state. For instance, the behavior associated with the desire to go to the Caribbean can’t just be making certain noises. <em>It has to be making those noises intentionally and sincerely.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the behaviorist says this, then he’s no longer talking about purely physical behavior! Contrast:</p>
  </li>
  <li>raising one’s arm (this is mentalistic behavior) vs. one’s arm moving in such-and-such ways (this is purely physical behavior)</li>
  <li>intentionally saying “I want to go to the Caribbean” (this is mentalistic behavior) vs. one’s mouth opening and certain noises coming out (this is purely physical behavior)</li>
  <li>Many definitions smuggle back in mental terms. I believe I have a 2pm appointment. That just means I arrive there. But that doesn’t seem sufficient to distinguish an appointment from something else.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, the behaviorist faces a dilemma. Either he says:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such purely physical behavior. But then the claims he makes won’t be plausible. There is no single physical way in which all creatures who are in pain behave.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, the behaviorist can say creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such mentalistic behavior. But if the behaviorist says this, then he hasn’t succeeded in reducing mental facts to purely physical facts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="three-types-of-behaviorism-again">Three Types of Behaviorism again</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Psychology is the science of behavior. Psychology is not the science of mind–as something other or different from behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behavior can be described and explained without making ultimate reference to mental events or to internal psychological processes. The sources of behavior are external (in the environment), not internal (in the mind, in the head).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In mental terms or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining behavior, then either (a) these terms or concepts should be eliminated and replaced by behavioral terms or (b) they can and should be translated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.</p>
