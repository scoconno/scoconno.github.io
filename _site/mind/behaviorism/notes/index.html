  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Those closest to us can read us the best. I can easily judge when my wife’s thoughts are elsewhere or my brother is troubling over his mortgage. I seem to know their minds, and they seem to know mine. If Descartes were right, then my loved ones’ minds are identical to their souls, immaterial and invisible entities. How then could I have knowledge of their minds? I can’t see their souls, but I often know what they are thinking and feeling without them telling me. How is this possible?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that mental state correlate with behavior and behavior is something that we can see. For our purposes, there are two types of behavior, physiological responses and bodily movements. Physiological responses are those automatic reactions to a stimulus, e.g., pupil dilation, sweating, etc. We are often unaware of many of these instinctive responses, e.g., flaring our nostrils, grinding our teeth, etc. Sometimes we are aware of them and sometimes we can stop, but the point is that we all automatically undergo various observable physical changes to stimuli.</p>

<p>A bodily movement, on the other hand, is an observable motion of some or all parts of the body. These include extending and retracting your limbs, turning your head from left to right, etc. This image depicts the range of bodily movements that are characteristic of our species.</p>

<p><img src="movements.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Our mental states seem correlated with our behaviors and attending to these behaviors seems to be how we judge what mental states others are in. A person in pain tends to wince and groan. A person that is excited tends to speak in a higher pitch and have dilated pupils. These correlations between mental states and behaviors, both physiological responses and bodily movements, are the basis of some significant discoveries and positions in modern psychology and philosophy of mind. The focus of this section is on one such position, namely, <em>behaviorism</em>.</p>

<h2 id="behaviorisms">Behaviorisms</h2>

<p>The word <em>behaviorism</em> connotes a number of things and it will be important in what follows for us to isolate the philosophical position that goes by that name. But, setting aside the many intricacies and differences, behaviorists of all types approach the study of the mind via the study of behavior. For instance, a therapist who calls themselves a behaviorist will not plumb the depths of their patients’ dreams and childhood memories. They are more likely to focus on problematic behaviors and their triggers. Therapy may consist in avoiding the triggers or being desensitized to them, e.g., treating a phobia by sensitizing the patient to whatever they fear. In both cases, the goal is really focused on changing the behavior. Likewise, animal psychologists who call themselves behaviorists study the minds of their favored animals via their behaviors. They learn how, say, a lion (my favorite), behaves when encountering a new situation. And, they assume that the relevant reaction is all we need focus on to learn about the mental states of that lion.</p>

<p>There are, though, different types of behaviorists with some thinking that behaviors give clues to the mind while others thinking that behavior is all there is to the mind. Distinguish three versions of behaviorism as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Methodological Behaviorism:</dt>
  <dd>Psychology is the science of behavior and of nothing other than behavior. This is a claim about how to practice psychology. It says that (1) the job of the psychologists is to explain why organisms’ behave the way they do, and (2) the only legitimate explanations a psychologist can offer are observable stimuli. The idea is that if psychology is to be a science, then it cannot concern itself with anything as murky as the inner workings of the mind. A hypothesis that, for instance, a person feels pain when they stub their toe must be testable if the hypothesis is a scientific one. And it is testable, says that methodological behaviorist, only if the inputs and outputs are observable by many, i.e., only if the hypothesis is about observable behaviors and stimuli. An animal psychologist, on this view, cannot talk about what a lion feels or thinks. Feelings and thoughts are not observable, so they should be no concern of the psychologist.</dd>
  <dt>Psychological Behaviorism:</dt>
  <dd>Psychology is a rich discipline that must explain many things and one of these things is behavior. Even if the methodological behaviorist is wrong, there are still questions to ask about why humans and animals behave as they do. Psychological behaviorists say that the sources of behavior are external and not internal, that the cause of our behavior is always an environmental cause and never an internal, mental causes.</dd>
  <dt>Philosophical, Ontological, Logical, Analytical, Radical Behaviorism:</dt>
  <dd>Mental statues just are behavioral dispositions. This is the view that concerns us and it is unfortunate that is goes by so many names. The first two behaviorisms were not theories about mental states. The first was a theory about a legitimate psychological explanation. The second was a theory about the explanation for behavior. Both of these theories can be agnostic about mental states, about whether they exist and what they are. Our third theory is not like this. It is a theory about the nature and existence of the mind. Namely, it claims that mental states are identical to sets of behaviors or behavioral dispositions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Such an identity may seem surprising. Just as Louise Lane was surprised to learn that Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same person, it would be surprising to learn that pain just is identical to some winces and moans. But that’s what philosophical behaviorists believe. They do not think there are any mental states inside that skull of yours—your mental states just are all those external, observable behavior. To say that a person has a belief that, say, it will rain later, just means that the person is likely to behave a certain way, e.g., carry an umbrella, say aloud the words ‘it will rain’, etc. The belief is not something inside their skull at all.</p>

<p>Consider this example: “Paul has a toothache”. This sentence is about Paul’s pain. Initially, you may think that the pain is residing somewhere inside Paul, that the pain is the cause of his winces and moans. But the philosophical behaviorist denies this. They do not think that the pain is the cause of that behavior. They think that the pain just is that behavior. And, so, they will claim that we can re-write the sentence in a way that speaks only about physiological responses and bodily movements. Here is Kim’s proposed translation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds.</li>
  <li>At the question “What is the matter?” Paul utters the words, “I have a toothache.”</li>
  <li>Closer examination reveals a decayed tooth with exposed pulp.</li>
  <li>Paul’s blood pressure, digestive processes, the speed of his reactions, show such and such changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that we have translated the sentence about pain so that we no longer refer to anything that is private, to anything that cannot be observed by scientists.</p>

<h2 id="argument-for-behaviorism">Argument for Behaviorism</h2>

<p>Philosophical behaviorism is a radical claim. Why accept it? Perhaps the best argument for it rests on some simple observations about the nature of language. Whatever else it may do, language is a means of communication, a means of directing other peoples’ attention, a means of getting them to do something, a means of getting them to believe something, etc. How we use language to do all this is a rich area of study that we could devote several semesters to. All we need observe here is that language can only be used a means of communication if the meanings of our phrases are publicly accessible. I can only succeed in directing your attention to the tiger with the word ‘tiger’ if we both agree upon what the word ‘tiger’ means. If you think it means a small plant with stripes, then I’ll hardly succeed in ensuring you attend to the large mammal running at us when I say, ‘look at that tiger!’.</p>

<p>Spoken language is no different here than other forms of communication. Sign language too only can be used to communicate if we agree about which shapes mean what. Morse code can also be used to communicate if we agree upon which sequences of dots means what. The same goes for even something as simple as traffic lights. They work only because we agree that a green light communicates to us that we are free to travel, while a red indicates you must stop. Language too works only if we agree and know what the various words we use mean and stand for.</p>

<p>If mental states exist and we can talk about them, then the words referring to mental states must be ones whose use we can agree upon. Just as a green light only successfully signals something because we all agree on what it signals, words like ‘pain’ and ‘pleasure’ can only communicate something if we all agree upon what they mean. But if mental states exist, they are by their nature accessible only to those that have them; they are not publicly accessible at all. How could we ever then agree upon what a word like ‘pain’ means?  This is partly why the famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein argues that mental states do not exist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word “pain” means – must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?
Now someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case! –Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a “beetle”. No one can look into anyone else’s box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. –Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. –But suppose the word “beetle” had a use in these people’s language? –If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty. –No, one can ‘divide through’ by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.
That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of ‘object and designation’ the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant. (Wittgenstein, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Sec. 293)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very innovative example, but let me change it a little. Suppose each of you has a box and that each of you use the word ‘baviga’ to describe what is in that box. Now, only you can see into that very special box. If anyone else tries to take a peak, the box will implode and the peekers will fail. But, just as nobody else can look inside your box, you cannot look inside the box of anyone else either. Everyone, though, uses the word ‘baviga’ to talk about what is inside their boxes. They say things like, ‘I have such a terrible baviga today’, ‘the baviga is not as bad today as yesterday’, ‘I wonder what will happen with my baviga tomorrow’, etc.</p>

<p>While each of you use the word ‘baviga’, how do you know that you are each using the word ‘baviga’ to describe the same type of thing? How do you know that what we each have in our respective boxes is the same? We can’t! They could be radically different types of things such that I would never use the word ‘baviga’ to describe what you are calling a baviga. The problem is that the referent of the word ‘baviga’ is in principle accessible only to the person who uses the word; it is impossible for us to access the one object and calibrate our language to ensure that we are referring to the same entity with the word ‘baviga’.</p>

<p>‘Baviga’ is a silly word that is useless for communication. What about mental terms, words like, ‘pain’, ‘belief’, ‘pleasure’, ‘itch’, ‘taste’, etc? Do you think that we can use these words to communicate with each other? If you do, then those words better not be like the word ‘baviga’. If we all use the word ‘pain’ to communicate, then the word should have the same meaning; it should refer to the same thing. But how do we know that when you say, ‘I am in pain’, and I say, ‘I am in pain’, that the word ‘pain’ in both sentences refers to the same thing? How do we know, in other words, that the thing I experience and call pain is anything like the thing you experience and call pain? If mental states are truly internal and private states, then we can never know this. We could be using the word to describe very different things altogether.</p>

<h2 id="verificationism">Verificationism</h2>
<p>If mental terms cannot have private meanings, what do they mean? If the word ‘pain’ does not refer to some internal mental state, what does the word refer to? We all use the word ‘pain’ and many other mental terms beside these. We use them in our conversations with one another and do so successfully. So, we must all agree on the meaning of ‘pain’ even if the behaviorist is right and the meaning is not some private mental state. If the word means the same for everyone, this means it derives its meaning solely from its use in some public context and not from any relevance to the private sensation of pain, i.e., it derives its meaning from something that we can all access and agree upon. But what is this publicly accessible thing that mental terms like ‘pain’ refer to?</p>

<p>One answer to this question is offered by verificationism, a position in the philosophy of language that was attractive to behaviorists. The view was often articulated with the slogan of one of its proponents, Schlick, who claimed the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The meaning of a statement consists in its method of verification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, also A.J Ayer in ‘Language, Truth and Logic’ claimed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sentence is only factually significant to a person if he or she knows what observations would lead him to accept the proposition as being true or false…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No statement which refers to a reality transcending the limits of all possible sense-experience can possible have any literal significance. (3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is that sentences, at least those that are truth apt, have clearly identifiable tests of their truth. Consider, for instance, ‘the cat is on the mat’. This sentence is either true or false—this is what I mean by being ‘truth apt’; the sentence is one or the other. I might not currently know if the sentence is true. I might be in the coffee shop unaware of what my cat is doing. Nevertheless, I know what observations could settle the matter. If I were to walk into my apartment and observe a grey, 12lb cat, breathing, and sitting on a mat, I would know that the sentence is true. If I observe no creature on the mat, the sentence is false. Verificationists claim that sentences are meaningful only if there are possible observable tests of their truth; they even claim that the meaning of a sentence consists in these verification conditions, i.e., consists in these observations that prove the sentence true or false.</p>

<p>My sentence about the cat was an easy one. The observations that verify it are straightforward and clearly connected to cats and mats. But the observations that verify a sentence can be more elaborate and indirect. For instance, many of the sentences in physics are verified by what you might consider indirect observations. We may not be able to see subatomic particles directly, but we can observe the tracks they make in a cloud chamber. So, the observations that verify sentences about subatomic particles will likely be observations about their effects, i.e., the sentence ‘a sub-atomic particle A has P’ is verified by some observation about the ionized gas particle in the cloud chamber.</p>

<p>Don’t worry too much about this example from physics. I include it only to stress that verificationism allows for many subtle and indirect observations to verify a sentence; they don’t think a term is meaningful only if you can directly see what it refers to.  You might indirectly see its referent by, for instance, seeing what effects the thing has. What is important is that 1) there are some clearly identifiable observations that would verify these sentences, 2) these observations are in principle possible by everyone–something is confirmable only if in principle confirmable by everyone, and 3) the meaning of a sentence consists in the set of these observations that prove it true or false.</p>

<p>Verificationism has an obvious upshot: if no observation can verify a sentence, the sentence is meaningless. And, by ‘meaningless’, I mean it is a string of sounds as meaningful as, say, ‘blah wah doo efle fople wittle.’ That’s obviously a non-sensical string of word. If no observation could confirm a sentence, the verificationist claims that sentence is similarly non-sensical. There are interesting questions about how to understand sentences about God according to verificationist. But we can set that aside and show the relationship between verificationism and behaviorism as an argument:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1. The meaning of a sentence is given by the conditions that must be verified to obtain if the sentence is true–call these <em>verification conditions.</em></li>
  <li>P2. If a sentence has a meaning that can be shared by different speakers, its verification conditions must be accessible to each speaker—that is, they must be publicly observable.</li>
  <li>P3. Only behavioral and physical phenomena (including physiological occurrences) are publicly observable.</li>
  <li>C. Therefore, the sharable meaning of any psychological sentence must be specifiable by statements of publicly observable verification conditions, that is, statements describing behavioral and physical conditions that must hold if the psychological statement is true.</li>
</ul>

<p>P1 and P2 is a statement of verificationism; it claims that the meaning of a sentence is given by its verification conditions <strong>and</strong> claims that these conditions must be given in terms of observable phenomena. P3 states that only behavior and physical phenomena are observable, e.g., chairs and twitches are observable. A mystic might deny P3, but the behaviorist is no mystic. Our conclusion states that any sentence that contains terms like ‘pain’, ‘itch’, etc., are meaningful only if they are about and verified by observations about our behaviors and physical bodies. So, for instance, ‘John feels confused’ is a meaningful sentence only if there is a set of observations that would verify it. These observations may be that a puzzled person wears a certain facial expression, will write a question into google if they have access to an internet connected device, will ask an expert if one is around, etc. John’s puzzlement, then, is not something inside  John’s skull. It is the set of observable behaviors and physical features that he displays associated with the meaning of ‘puzzlement’.</p>

<h2 id="objections-to-behaviorism">Objections to Behaviorism</h2>

<p>Behaviorism is a powerful theory that had many defenders, but it has fallen out of favor for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Causation</strong>
If behaviorism is true, mental states do not cause anything. For instance, my pain does not cause me to grimace. My pain just is the grimacing. The grimacing is caused by, say, stubbing my toe, or spraining a muscle. But we ordinarily think that behavior is caused by our mental states. We think we buy the ice-cream because we want the ice-cream. We don’t think our desire is just the purchase. Again, we treat our partners well because we love them. Our love isn’t reducible to all the various ways we treat them. But if behaviorism is true, we are wrong to think these things. Our love, desires, pains, and hopes cannot be the cause of anything. They are just the ways we behave.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge of our own minds</strong>
The behaviorist explains our knowledge of others’ mental states, but they cannot explain knowledge of our own mental states. We don’t need to observe our behavior to know how we’re feeling, e.g., I don’t need to look at in a mirror to see a grimace to know that I am in pain. Whether I’m in pain, or want ice-cream, or hope for rain, seems to a matter of what’s going on in me right now, which I can be directly aware of. It doesn’t seem to be a matter of how I would act in certain hypothetical situations. But if behaviorism is true, it would be a matter about how I act in hypothetical scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Single mental states do not have distinctive behaviors</strong>
The behaviorist claims that each mental state is associated with some distinctive behaviors. But this seems implausible. One person screams when they feel pain. Another person bites their tongue and remains silent–perhaps they are training to be an army ranger and need to prove themselves. But if behaviorism is true, we would expect the same behavior for every mental state.</p>

<p>Another way of raising this problem is to note that it is difficult to say what behavior is associated with what mental state without making assumptions about what other mental states the person has. Consider the behaviorist’s account of wanting ice-cream. X wants ice-cream if and only if:</p>

<ol>
  <li>X is disposed to read the dessert menu before reading the main menu–this assumes that X does not want food from the main menu, so we need to assume a want when analyzing X’ want for ice-cream.</li>
  <li>X is disposed to purchase ice-cream if given a voucher for ice-cream–this depends on whether X believes that the voucher will work, whether X intends to keep his weight in check, etc. So, here we have explained what it is to want ice-cream by appealing to more mental states like belief and intent.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that we can’t describe behavior in purely physical terms. So, we can’t describe the behavior associated with a mental state in purely physical terms. For instance, the behavior associated with the desire for ice-cream can’t just be making certain noises. It has to be making those noises intentionally and sincerely, i.e., while having other mental states. But if the behaviorist says this, then he’s no longer talking about purely physical behavior.</p>

<p>Hence, the behaviorist faces a dilemma. Either he says that creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such purely physical behavior. But then the claims he makes won’t be plausible. There is no single physical way in which all creatures who are in pain behave.  Alternatively, the behaviorist can say creatures with mental state M are disposed to engage in such-and-such mentalistic behavior. But if the behaviorist says this, then he hasn’t succeeded in reducing mental facts to purely physical facts.</p>
