  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>What a case! You have never seen one like it in all these years of  working for the Gothic Knight Law Firm. A gorilla called Koko? Your clients want you to petition the courts for emancipation. That will be tough. You need to convince the courts that keeping Koko in captivity is as bad as keeping a human being in captivity. The case raises all kinds of tricky philosophical issues, but you settle on a strategy. Logical behaviorism is a theory of mind that shows Koko to enjoy mentality as much as any human being does. You first need to take a careful note of behaviors that most resemble those of a human being. Observation in hand, you can then use use logical behaviorism to prove that she has a mind.</p>

<p>You can watch Koko here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh1uhrdc6w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh1uhrdc6w</a></p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charitably explaining arguments for views that are not your own.</li>
  <li>Explaining difficult concepts in your own words.</li>
  <li>Applying a theory to test a controversial case.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Write the <strong>legal brief</strong> to the court. You can find a sample legal brief <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/legal-writing/students/memorandum/memorandum-3.html">here</a>. Include all four sections and include the titles of these sections (you can make up the laws for this essay)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Question: what is the case about? One sentence.</li>
  <li>Short Answer: A one sentence summary of your case.</li>
  <li>Facts: A detailed list of <em>some</em> of Koko’s most human like behaviors. Again, watch some of this documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh1uhrdc6w">here</a></li>
  <li>Discussion: this should have two parts:
    <ol>
      <li>An explanation of logical behaviorism and the argument for it.</li>
      <li>An application of this theory to Koko and her behavior (which you outlined in the ‘facts’ section.)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will result in a loss of points.</p>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.</p>
