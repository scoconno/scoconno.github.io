  <h2 id="consciousness">Consciousness</h2>

<p>Turing thought it obvious that the capacity to imitate a human was sufficient for a machine to enjoy mentality. It certainly is sufficient if mentality consists entirely in the abilty to ask questions, give answers, joke, tease, lament and symphatesize. In other words, if all there is to having a mind is the ability to hold a conversation, then machines could one day enjoy mentality (if they don’t already). But Searle’s thought experiment seems to show that there is something more to the mind than just the ability to have conversations; something that the machine is cruciall lacking. At this point, it should seem no surprise to learn that many think that this missing ingredient is consciousenss. And consciousness, whatever it is, is not something enjoyed by a machine regardless of how loquacious it may be.</p>

<p>But why think that consciousness is not enjoyed by a machine? Isn’t the machine aware of the people it is talking to? Isn’t a robotic car aware of the obstacles it successfully navigates on the road? If being aware is sufficient for being conscious, then robotic cars are clearly conscious. In this section and the next, we will try get clearer on this question by asking about the nature of consciousness, what exactly is it that we take humans to possess and machines to lack? There are two distinct questions we will focus on, one in the each week:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is consciousness? What are its features? How best can they be described?</li>
  <li>How does consciousness come to exist? If from the brain, how so?</li>
</ol>

<p>Our first question asks us to identify the defining features of consciousness. Should it be characterized as mere awareness of the external world? If not, what else is it? Is there just one phenomeneon of consciousness or might there be several different phenomena that we use the same word to describe? If so, what are these different phenomena?</p>

<p>Our second question asks how consciousness exists. The 19th century biologist puts the question as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what consciousness is, we know not; and how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story, or as any other ultimate fact of nature (Huxley).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Humans are consciouss and our consciousness has something to do with our brains. But what is that ‘something’? Just how could a brain produce consciousness in the first place? This second question is, of course, related to the first. If we learn that there are, in fact, two types of consciousness, then we will need to determine how the brain gives rise to each type. We will focus on the second question next week.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat">“What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”</h2>

<p>Our entry point for our discussion of conscioussness if Thomas Nagel’s seminal 1974 paper “What is it like to be a bat?”. The paper restored consciousness as a central problem in philosophy and neuroscience, for, as Nagel convinced us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena is very poorly understood (436).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nagel begins Conscious Creatures:</p>

<p><img src="animals.jpg" alt="Animal Consciousness" /></p>

<p><img src="Aliens.jpg" alt="Alien Consciousness" /></p>

<p><img src="Zombies.jpg" alt="What is missing?" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not analyzable in terms of any explanatory system of functional states, or intentional states, since these could be ascribed to robots or automata that behaved like people though they experienced nothing (436).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nagel uses the examples of bats to argue for the ‘what it’s like’ quality of consciousness:</p>

<p><img src="bat.jpg" alt="Echolocation" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bats are mammals.</li>
  <li>They have conscious experience.</li>
  <li>Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects.</li>
  <li>Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptional experiences.</li>
  <li>What it’s like to see a bug is different from what it’s like to echolocate that bug.</li>
  <li>What it’s like to a human differs from what it’s like to be a bat.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is not confined to exotic cases, however, for it exists between one person and another. The subjective character of the experience of a person deaf and blind from birth is not accessible to me, for example, nor presumably is mine to him. This does not prevent us each from believing that the other’s experience has such a subjective character.(440)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="qualia">Qualia</h2>

<p>“What it is like” refers to the specific qualitative character of experiences, e.g., the redness of a visual percept, the hurtfulness of a pain, the smell of fresh newsprint, the tactile feel of a cool marble surface, etc. An itch feels different from a tickle. A sharp pain feels different from a burning one. Thirst feels different from hunger. Seeing something that looks green is different from seeing something that looks blue. T</p>

<p>Imagine a chili on your tongue. Now imagine a chocolate on your tongue. Not only can you tell the difference between the chocolate and the chili, the chocolate and chili cause  different conscience feelings in you. It feels a certain way when you taste chocolate, and it feels a certain way when you taste a chili, and those two feelings are different. Philosophers use the word ‘qualia’ to refer to these qualitative aspects of experiences, though the following are also used:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Phenomenal properties</li>
  <li>Phenomenological properties</li>
  <li>Raw feels</li>
  <li>What it’s like</li>
</ol>

<p>These terms are ways of getting you to identify something you are already familiar with it. They aren’t meant to introduce you to something new. If you are not already familiar from your own mental life that mental states have a dis­tinctive feel, these words will mean nothing to you.</p>

<p>Bodily sensations and perceptual experiences clearly have qualia. Cognitive states likes beliefs, hopes, and emotions don’t clearly have such qualia, or, at least, they are not individuated by the qualia they have. So, for instance, anger and pride may have certain feelings associated with them, but they aren’t merely certain feelings. Pride and anger also have different propositional contents associated with them, e.g., pride has some belief about merit attached.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence for qualia. Consider first your experience of color:</p>

<p><img src="figure1.gif" alt="Colors" /></p>

<p>It is tempting to think that your experience of color is to be explained fully in terms of the properties and features of what you see. The content of your experience just is the external object and its features. But there seems to be something more to our expierences than the objects we experience and their properties. Imagine that a person, Ted, suffers an unusual brain injury. The parts of his brain responsible for vision inverts the colors of the objects they had experienced in the past:</p>

<p><img src="inverted.jpg" alt="Inverted" /></p>

<p>Before Ted’s accident, he placed a strawberry in his fridge. That strawberry appeared red to him. After the injury, he returns to the fridge and takes out the strawberry. But it now looks green to him! He is very unsettled by this. Green looks so different than red. Obviously, there is more to Ted’s experience of the strawberry than just the external object. His perceptual experience of the strawberry has properties, perceptual properties, or qualia, that are different from the properties of the strawberry. These properties changed after the brain injury. The strawberries did not.</p>

<p>We don’t need such a bizarre example to be convinced that there are qualia. Consider that sensational dress that caused such an internet outcry. What color is it?</p>

<p><img src="dress.jpg" alt="What color is the dress?" /></p>

<p>Some were adamant that the dress was white and gold. Others were adamant that it was blue and black. Neither group would budge. Both groups saw the same dress, but the qualia of their relevant perceptions of the dress were different.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-consciousness">Types of consciousness</h2>

<p>The notion of qualia, or “what it’s like” allows us draw some interesting distinctions about consciousness. Consider this claim by Nagel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fundamentally an organism has <strong>conscious mental states</strong> if and only if there is <strong>something that it is like to <em>be</em> that organism</strong>-something it is like <em>for</em> the organism (436)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nagel in fact is really pointing to two phenomena. 1) What it is like to be a creature of a certain sort, and 2) what it’s like to have a mental state of a certain sort.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>State Consciousness:</dt>
  <dd>a state of a creature is conscious if there is something it is like to be in that state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some conscious states
1. Pain: there is something it is like to experience pain in a burned finger. 
2. Vision: there is something it is like to see a large red circle painted on a white wall.
3. Smell:  there is something it is like to smell a rotten egg.</p>

<p>Some non-conscious states
1. Bodily states: there is nothing that is like to have hair grow (though there is something that is like to <em>feel</em> your hair grow. 
2. Your age and weight.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Creature (subject) Consciousness:</dt>
  <dd>A conscious creature is one that is capable of having conscious states.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="phenomenal-and-access-consciousness">Phenomenal and Access Consciousness</h2>

<p>Noticing that there are qualia allows us to raise interesting questions about consciousness and ask some pressing questions. Consider these two cases:</p>

<p><strong>Blindsight</strong></p>

<p><strong>Subconscious Thought</strong>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SomZ6aViWGY</p>

<p>The first video discussed cases of blindsight. You may, for instance, place a ball in the sphere of some blind person’s vision and ask them to grasp it with their hand. They claim they cannot see the ball, but they succeed in grasping it anyway. And their success matches the success of the sighted, e.g., they grasp the ball as quickly and as reliably as those with vision grasp it. The second video introduce us to cases of subconscious thoughts. While driving to school or work with a friend, we may not be consciously focusing on the road. Nevertheless, we navigate the obstacles as if we were focusing like a new driver. We adjust our speed to the cars around us. We steer to avoid a pothole. But if anyone asked you what you were thinking about, you would respond that your mind was on the conversation.</p>

<p>What is going on in both these cases? Ned Block has introduced the following important distinction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phenomenal consciousness is experience; what makes a state phenomenally conscious is that there is something “it is like” to be in that state (Block, “On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness”, p.377)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A mental state is phenomenally conscious, then, just if it has qualia. This contrasts to the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A state is A-conscious [access-conscious] if it is poised for direct control of thought and action. To add more detail, a representation is [access]-conscious if it is poised for free use in reasoning and for direct “rational” control of action, and speech. An [access-conscious] state is one that consists in having an [access-conscious] representation (Block, “On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness,”, p. 382.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you notice the swerving car, you can complain about that car to your friend. Since you were able to do something with the awareness of the car, i.e., think and talk about that car’s behavior, your thought of that car is a-conscious (as well as p-conscious). So, a thought is a-conscious if it is broadcast to the creatures brain. Such thoughts are posed to interact with a wide variety of the creature’s other thoughts and to directly drive its behavior. Access conscious thoughts are usually the ones you can report if someone were to ask you, what are you thinking now?</p>

<p>There are three ways of relating access consciousness (a-consciousness) and phenomenal consciousness (p-consciousness).</p>

  <li>A-consciousness together with p-consciousness, e.g., driving successfully, you are p-conscious of the cars and report their behavior to your friend.</li>
  <li>P-consciousness without a-consciousness, e.g., driving successfully, you are p-conscious of the cars, but do not actively think about or report their behavior to your friend. Instead, you talk about your latest philosophy course.</li>
  <li>A-consciousness without p-consciousness, e.g., driving successfully, the robot car reports the behavior of the other cars to the neural network. But the robot car is not p-conscious of its surroundings.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="blindsight">Blindsight</h2>

<p>Return now to our problematic cases. Blindsight is a case where you have a-consciousness without p-consciousness. How might this happen? The human visual system is divided into two separate subsystems - the ventral and dorsal subsystems.</p>

<p><img src="dorsal.jpg" alt="Ventral and dorsal subsystems" /></p>

<p>The ventral system is responsible for object recognition and classification. It is responsible for recognizing that an object is a chair as opposed to a dolphin, a tree as opposed to a building, etc. The dorsal system is is responsible for recognizing spatial features such as location and motion, e.g., for recognizing that the dog is moving and that the dog is closer to us than the cat. Block associates P-consciousness with the ventral system. It’s noticeable that in blindsight there seems to be damage to the ventral system.</p>

<p>Of course, you might claim that these people don’t have a-consciousness of the stimuli in their blind region. Blindsight patients must be prompted by an experimenter before they will ‘take a guess’. But Block asks us to imagine a super-blindsighter who had acquired the ability to guess when to guess about the content of her blind field. Even though she doesn’t see the objects in her blind field, she can spontaneously offer verbal reports about those objects. Information about her blind field just spring into her thoughts. A super-blindsighter would be a-conscious but not p-conscious.</p>

<h2 id="p-consciousness-without-a-consciousness">P-consciousness without A-consciousness</h2>

<p><strong>Case 1: Damage</strong></p>

<p>Suppose the damage occurred the other way. That there was damage to the dorsal system, but not the ventral system. Block believes that in such cases we would have f P-Consciousness without A-Consciousness. Unlike the blindsight case, though, note that the person with p but not a conscious would not be able to report to us what they are p-conscious about. Lacking a-Consciousness implies that the content of the p-conscious state is not available for rational manipulation, including reporting things like “I see a blue goose”.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2: subconscious thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Our subconscious experiences have qualia and they may even cause us to behave in certain ways. But these subconscious states are not available for direct rational control. They are not immediately available for us to deliberate about and knowingly act upon. So even if they effect our behavior, they do not do so in the same way our rational deliberation effects our behavior. These states then are p-conscious without being a-conscious. Some of these states can, of course, become a-conscious. For instance, perhaps the sound of a jackhammer has caused you to grimace as you were absorbed in a good book. You didn’t realize you were grimacing and you didn’t give any of your attention to that noise. But once you put down the book, you might notice that you are grimacing and the cause is that noise. You can then deliberate about whether to call in a noise complaint, shut the window, or leave the house. In this case, you become a-conscious of the state that was previously causing your grimace.</p>

<p>Do animals have phenomenal consciousness without access consciousness?</p>

<h2 id="self-knowledge">Self-Knowledge</h2>

<p>There are mental states we are aware of and mental states that we are not. How is this possible? This is the problem of self-knowledge, of how we can gain knowledge of our minds. Let us introduce a distinction between first and second order mental states to characterize this self-knowledge.</p>

<p><img src="dog.jpg" alt="First vs. Second" /></p>

<p><img src="second.jpg" alt="First vs. Second" /></p>

<dl>
  <dt>First order mental states:</dt>
  <dd>States that are not about the mind, including states that are about the external world, e.g., seeing a tree, hearing music, etc.</dd>
  <dt>Second order mental states:</dt>
  <dd>States that are about first order mental states, e.g., our awareness of our sight of the tree.</dd>
</dl>

<p>We have special access to our mental states, an access that has two special features.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Privilege: We have special authority over our mental states. Your belief that you are in a certain mental state has more epistemic weight than any third person judgement about your states, e.g., someone else could judge wrongly as to whether you are in pain, but you cannot judge wrongly as to whether you are in pain.</li>
  <li>Peculiarity: the manner by which know which mental states you are in differs from the manner by which others know which mental states you are in. They do so by watching your behavior, or listening to your reports, etc. But your knowledge of your own mind is not based on or inferred from evidence about other things. You know what mental states you have and what they are like having these states in some special way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Self-reflection relates to our previous topic as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Claim 1:</dt>
  <dd>Access consciousness involves an awareness of one’s own mental states–the difference between a conscious and unconscious first order mental state is that we have awareness of the former, but not the latter.</dd>
</dl>

<p><em>Example 1:</em> You see the road and hear the traffic, but you are not aware of what you see and what you hear when you are talking to your friend. You become aware of what you see and what you hear by becoming aware of your awareness of the car and the traffic.</p>

<p><em>Example 2:</em> The person in an agitated state does not notice the pain in their side when shot or injured during battle. When they become aware of their pain, they have a second order mental state about their first order mental state.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Claim 2:</dt>
  <dd>A creature is conscious just in case it is capable of being aware of its own first order mental states.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Our question is this: <strong>How do we become aware of our first-order mental states?</strong></p>

<p>We will compare and contrast two answers. Both say that we become aware of our mental states by internally scanning those states, by being in a higher order meta-psychological state. But they characterize this meta-psychological state in different ways.</p>

<h3 id="higher-order-perception">Higher Order Perception</h3>

<p><img src="third.jpg" alt="Internal Perceptions" /></p>

<p>HOP: A mental state is a conscious state just in case there is a higher order perception of it–or perception of being in that state.</p>

<p>Our first theory states that higher order states are very much like perceptual states. To be in these higher order states is akin to seeing, or smelling, or hearing, etc. Just as we see the color,  so too we have an inner perception of our mental states. Such a view is often called an inner sense theory of consciousness as defenders of this view believe that we become aware of our mental states by sensing them, e.g., just as you can look around the room, so too you can ‘look’ around your mind.</p>

<p><strong>In favor of HOP</strong></p>

<p>One way of defending HOP is to argue that the awareness of our mental states has the same features as our perceptions of the external world. Analogously, a person might try argue that some music belongs to a particular genre by arguing that the music appropriately resembles that genre. For instance, one might argue Joy Division’s music belongs to the genre of post-punk as follows: post-punk music is experimental and anti-corporatist. Joy Divisions’s music was experimental and anti-corporatist. Therefore, Joy Division’s music was post-punk.</p>

<p>The argument for HOP has a similar strategy: 1) perception has some features, x, y, z. 2) Awareness of our own mind has features x, y, z. 3) Thus we are aware of our own minds by perceiving them.</p>

<p>Here are two similarities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sense modalities respond differentially to a range of stimuli. We see some things clearly and others not so clearly, e.g., the house in the distance is obscure and hazy, but appears clear and distinct as we approach. Our awareness of our own minds has a similar features. Some mental states appear clear and distinctly. Others are hazy and nondescript, e.g., a nagging pain might have an unclear location, but a sharp pain is easy to locate.</li>
  <li>Sense modalities respond directly. Flash a bright light in someone’s eyes and there is an immediate perception. Our awareness of our mind also seems to respond directly. Your attention can be brought immediately to the pain in your stubbed toe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since our awareness of our mind is similar to our perceptual capacities in these two ways, one might conclude we are aware of our mental states by perceiving those states.</p>

<p><strong>Against HOP</strong></p>

<p>I argued that Joy Division’s music was post-punk by claiming that their music has some features of post-punk music. One way of blocking this argument is to find some other important feature of post-punk that is not shared by Joy Division’s music, e.g., post-punk is not melodic, but Joy Division’s is.</p>

<p>A similar strategy is used to show that we are not aware of our mental states by perceiving them, i.e., a strategy that identifies important differences between our awareness of our minds and our perception of the external world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mental states do not exemplify a single range of stimuli as sensory modalities do. Hearing is of sound. Vision is of color and shape. Smell is of odors. If we are aware of our mental states by strictly perceiving them, then it seems there should be some specific range of stimuli that this inner perception detects. But it detects a wide range of very disparate mental states, so it doesn’t seem like perception at all.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="dog.jpg" alt="What difference?" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Since each perceptual experience has unique content, we expect our higher order perception to have some unique content, content that distinguishes it from first order mental states, in particular, first order perceptual states. But what is this content?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="organ.jpg" alt="What does the perceiving?" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each sense modality has its own organ. So, higher order perception require its own organ. But there is no such organ.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ordinary perceptions sometimes malfunction. If we are aware of our mental states by perceiving them, then this perception should also be capable of malfunction. But it seems incoherent that someone could have an accurate first-order perception while having a false higher-order perception.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="higher-order-thought">Higher Order Thought</h2>

<p>Our alternative theory denies that we are aware of our mental states by perceiving them. Rather, the claim that we are aware of our mental states by thinking about them.</p>

<p><img src="date.jpg" alt="Inner Thoughts" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The awareness of our mental states is conceptual (not perceptual). It is by coming to believe that I am undergoing an experience of red that the experience becomes phenomenally conscious, e.g., I say to myself ‘I am experiencing something red’ and saying this to myself is what explains why I am aware of the red experience.</li>
  <li>Some believe that the higher-order thought accompanies the experience itself — it is actually occurring at the same time. Others believe that it does not need to actually occur at the same time, but believe that the first order mental states must be immediately available for us to think about (even if we aren’t actually thinking about them). This distinction isn’t that important for our purposes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-are-thoughts">What are thoughts?</h2>
<p>If we are aware of our mental states by thinking about them, but not perceiving them, then we need to characterize the difference between thinking and perceiving. What is the difference between seeing that the tree is green and thinking that the tree is green? The distinction is often made in terms of the contents of these different states; the contents of perception and thoughts are supposedly of different types.</p>

<p>Thoughts are mental states with conceptual content. But what does that mean? A standard dictionary entry isn’t that helpful:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Conceptual content:</dt>
  <dd>A semantically evaluable, redeployable constituent of thought, invoked to explain properties of intentional phenomena such as productivity and systematicity. Applied to an assortment of phenomena including mental representations, images, words, stereotypes, senses, properties, reasoning abilities, mathematical functions, etc. (Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind)</dd>
  <dt>Nonconceptual content:</dt>
  <dd>A content, possibly of a non- or sub- doxastic state, whose canonical specification employs concepts which the subject need not possess in order to entertain the content, but rather might, for instance, be canonically specified in terms of abilities and skills the subject possesses, or in terms of significant though nonconceptualized experience. (Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yikes! These definitions are hard, but the simple idea is that nonconceptual content is content that can be specified without words and concepts available to whoever or whatever is in that state. If insects have mental states, the content of those states might very well be nonconceptual as insects don’t have concepts they can use to describe that content. Conceptual content, on the other hand, is content that is characterizable by the words and concepts available to whoever is in that state. In other words, if a butterfly has a state with conceptual content, then the butterfly must have available to it the conceptual resources to characterize that content.</p>

<p>Conceptual content is also often characterized as propositional and thought characterized as a propositional attitude. A proposition is whatever comes after a ‘that’ clause, e.g., in the sentence “Socrates said that Meno was at the part last night”, the proposition <em>Meno was at the party last night</em> is one that Socrates apparently reported. Every proposition is either true or false. The sentence “Yeah for chocolate” is neither true nor false, so it does not express a proposition. “There is chocolate on the plate” is a proposition as this sentence is either true or false (unfortunately false as I write these notes). It’s not important what language we use to express a proposition. Different languages can express the very same content.</p>

<p>There are also different attitudes we can take towards one and the same propositions, e.g., hoping that the cat is on the mat, believing that the cat is on the mat, etc.</p>

<p>The claim that a thought is a mental state with conceptual content is best understood then as the claim that thoughts are propositional attitudes where the content can be characterized with words that whoever is in that state possesses. The HOT theory say that our awareness of our first mental states—those mental states that are conscious as opposed to unconscious—just  consists in one’s having a thought that one is in that very mental state, e.g., my awareness of my red experience just consists in my having the thought “I am having a reading experience”, or perhaps “there is a red experience is occurring.” Notice that I have to possess these words and concepts in order to have this thought.</p>

<p><strong>In favor of HOT over HOP</strong> 
1. Thinking is not limited to a single range of stimuli in the way perception is limited. 
2. Thinking is just as immediate as perception. 
3. Thinking does not require an internal sense organ.</p>

<p><strong>Against HOT</strong> 
1. I am aware of things that I don’t have any concepts for and thus cannot have any thoughts about.</p>

<p><img src="green.png" alt="Colors" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>I am aware of my thoughts, e.g., I say to myself ‘stop thinking about whether to eat the chocolate you smell and think instead about class tomorrow’. Here I have a second oder thought about chocolate, or rather, I am aware of the sight of chocolate. But I also have a higher order thought about that second order thought, namely, I should stop having that second order thought. Is this a third order thought?</li>
