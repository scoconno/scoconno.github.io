  <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>

<p>Welcome! My name is Dr. Scott O’Connor, and I’ll be your instructor for this course. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in fall, 2014. Before my arrival, I received a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are ancient philosophy and metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website.</p>

<p>While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O’Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No ‘hey’, ‘yo’, ‘what’s up’, smiley face, etc. See <a href="/contact">contact</a> for further information.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>There is a dedicated module for each week. You will find these under ‘weeks’ in Blackboard. Each week will become live on the Monday morning of that week. One exception is the final week, which will become live earlier. In the module for each week, there are two links:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Materials</li>
  <li>Essay or Quiz</li>
</ol>

<p>The materials link will take you to a dedicated page for the week’s topic. It contains extensive notes, which you should read thoroughly. I also include readings not in the textbook. Since some of the material is tricky, I try to include some combination of short stories, videos, and podcasts. I recommend the following work schedule for each week:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the assigned pages from the textbook (or the relevant papers). On this first read, skim and get the basic idea. Don’t stress if you struggle to understand the material on this first read.</li>
  <li>Read my notes.</li>
  <li>Read the short stories, watch the videos, listen to the podcasts (whatever I have assigned).</li>
  <li>Re-read the assigned pages for the week. This time read them carefully and take detailed notes.</li>
  <li>If my notes and the supplementary material do not answer any of your questions, send me a message through Blackboard. Do this before Saturday if you want an answer before you submit an assignment.</li>
  <li>Complete the assignments. These are due on Monday at midnight. You will have one week for each assignment. No late work is accepted. There are no make-ups offered. See my note on this below.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>Please find details about the textbook on the syllabus. I will photocopy some readings for weeks 1 and 2, but you will need the textbook from week 3 onwards. The book is available online and in the campus bookstore. The textbook I chose is a compromise between quality and price. Some others are easier, but much more expensive. This means that some of the chapters in this textbook are less accessible than I would like. I will remedy this by providing supplemental reading and videos on the website.</p>

<h2 id="late-work-and-extra-credit">Late work and extra credit</h2>
<p>Students sometimes ask to submit work late or ask for a make-up opportunity. I used to receive many of these requests and found it difficult to adjudicate them. I also want to treat my students equally and am frustrated by students who expect special treatment. But, students do get sick. Life does get in the way. So, here is what I do instead of accepting late work and offering make-ups: I assign more essays and quizzes than are needed to complete the course. There is an assignment every week, either a quiz or essay. You don’t have to do all of them. Check the syllabus for full details. So, if you miss an assignment, then just complete the following week’s work. You can afford to do this a few times. Again, check the syllabus.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to complete the required number of assignments due to illness, personal problems, etc, then you should withdraw from the course. NJCU also offers medical withdrawals for students who miss the ordinary withdrawal dates. So, moral of the story: I will teach you the material and help you complete the assignments, but I will not entertain requests for extra credit or accept late work. Please don’t ask.</p>

<h2 id="technical-help">Technical Help</h2>

<p>All Blackboard activity is recorded. I see when you log on, what you click, and how long you stay on the pages you click. Blackboard outages are rare and are automatically reported to me. If you encounter technical difficulties, the most likely source will be a difficulty with your browser or computer. Do take a moment to ensure your browser is up to date. If you are uncertain how to use Blackboard or have some technical difficulty, please consult NJCU’s online learning resources here: <a href="http://newlearning.njcu.edu/dl/enrolled.htm">http://newlearning.njcu.edu/dl/enrolled.htm</a></p>

<p>I occasionally have students report that their computer crashes one minute before an assignment is due. My response is always the same: it is your responsibility to ensure that you are using a reliable computer on a stable internet connection. If your computer crashed one minute before an assignment is due, I encourage you to reflect on whether leaving the assignment to the last minute was a responsible strategy.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read the syllabus carefully. Course policies vary by professors, sometimes significantly. I don’t allow make-ups, but other professors do. You need to understand the policies that govern this course and understand what is required of you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read ch.1 of the textbook, on this week’s list of materials, as well as my introduction to the course under ‘notes’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no assignments in this first week. Familiarize with the website and materials. Contact me if you have questions about the policies. And get ready for next week!</p>
  </li>
</ol>
