<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome! I’m Dr. Scott O’Connor, and I’ll be your instructor for this course. Originally from Dublin, I joined the Philosophy Department at NJCU in Fall 2014. Before my arrival, I received a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Cornell University. My areas of specialization are ancient philosophy and metaphysics, though I have broad, general interests in philosophy too. If you want to know a bit more about me, then you can learn about my research on this website.</p>

<p>While you are my student, the appropriate way to address me is as Dr. O’Connor. Since your messages and emails are archived, I encourage you to adopt a professional, friendly tone in our communications. No ‘hey’, ‘yo’, ‘what’s up’, smiley face, etc. See <a href="/contact">contact</a> for further information.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>There is a dedicated module for each week. You will find these under ‘weeks’ in Blackboard. Each week will become live on the Monday morning of that week. One exception is the final week, which will become live on a Friday.  Each week will include some combination of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instructions.</li>
  <li>Notes.</li>
  <li>Assignments.</li>
  <li>Optional Readings.</li>
  <li>Media, e.g., video clips, blogs, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>Please find details about the textbook on the syllabus. I will photocopy some readings for weeks 1 and 2, but you will need the textbook from week 3 onwards. The book is available online and in the campus bookstore.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments per week, one essay and one quiz. Both are found on Blackboard. You will find a full description on the syllabus, but let me emphasize here again the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Assignments are normally due on a Monday by 11:59pm. During the last week, the assignments are due on the Thursday at 11:59pm. Note, though, that the final week’s module will become live earlier than previous weeks.</li>
  <li>You must complete 5 of the 7 assigned quizzes. If you complete more than 5, the lowest grades will be dropped.</li>
  <li>You must complete 5 of the 7 assigned essays. If you complete more than 5, the lowest grades will be dropped.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that we must cover 3 credits worth of material in our time together. So expect to spend about 12 hours per week on the readings and assignments. If this work load is too high for you, then reconsider taking this class.</p>

<h2 id="late-work-and-extra-credit">Late work and extra credit</h2>
<p>Students sometimes ask to submit work late or ask for a make-up opportunity. I used to receive many of these requests and found it difficult to adjudicate them. I also want to treat my students equally and am frustrated by students who expect special treatment.</p>

<p>But, students do get sick. Life does get in the way. So, here is what I do instead of accepting late work and offering extra credit: I assign more essays and quizzes than are needed to complete the course. And, if someone is unable to complete 5 of the 7 assigned quizzes and 5 of the 7 assigned essays due to illness, personal problems, etc, then they should withdraw from the course. NJCU also offers medical withdrawals for students who miss the ordinary withdrawal dates. So, moral of the story: I will teach you the material and help you complete the assignments, but I will not entertain requests for extra credit or accept late work. Please don’t ask.</p>

<h2 id="technical-help">Technical Help</h2>

<p>All Blackboard activity is recorded. I see when you log on, what you click, and how long you stay on the pages you click. Blackboard outages are rare and are automatically reported to me. If you encounter technical difficulties, the most likely source will be a difficulty with your browser or computer. By taking this course, you are indicating that you have sufficient computer literacy. If at any point, you are uncertain how to use Blackboard or have some technical difficulty, please consult NJCU’s online learning resources here: <a href="http://newlearning.njcu.edu/dl/enrolled.htm">http://newlearning.njcu.edu/dl/enrolled.htm</a></p>

<p>I occasionally have online students report that their computer crashes 1 minute before a test is due. My response is always the same: it is your responsibility to ensure you are using a reliable computer on a stable internet connection. If your computer crashed one minute before it was due, I encourage you to reflect on whether leaving the assignment to the last minute was a responsible strategy.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Read the syllabus carefully. Course policies vary by professors, sometimes significantly. I don’t allow make-ups, but other professors do. You need to understand the policies that govern this course and understand what is required of you.</li>
  <li>Complete Week 1.</li>
</ol>
