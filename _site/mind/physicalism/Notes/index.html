  <dt><strong>Physicalism:</strong></dt>
  <dd>everything is physical or that everything supervenes on the physical.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here is one way to understand ‘supervenience’: 
&gt; A dot-matrix picture has global properties — it is symmetrical, it is cluttered, and whatnot — and yet all there is to the picture is dots and non-dots at each point of the matrix. The global properties are nothing but patterns in the dots. They supervene: no two pictures could differ in their global properties without differing, somewhere, in whether there is or there isn’t a dot (Lewis, 1986, p. 14).</p>

<p><img src="dot1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="dot2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The analogy works like this:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Local features:</dt>
  <dd>The physical features of the world are like the dots in the picture. These physical features of the world include fundamental elementary particles like quarks and leptons as well as ‘force particles’, the bosons.</dd>
  <dt>Global features:</dt>
  <dd>Just as there are global features of the picture–features that supervene on the local features of the picture–so too there are global features that supervene on the physical features of the world.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Notice that the global features of the picture are nothing but a pattern in the dots. You could only change the global features of the picture by changing the dots, i.e., changing which dots are pressed and how far they are pressed. You could change how cluttered the picture is by changing which dots there are (or are pressed).</p>

<p>Physicalism claims that all features of the world are physical features or supervene on the physical features (or are nothing but a pattern in the physical features.) On this view, all biological, chemical, psychological, and social features, etc., of the world are nothing but a kind of pattern in the physical features. This entails that there can be no biological or chemical or social change, etc. without a change in the pattern of physical features. If a heart stops pumping blood, some change will have occurred in the physical features that the heart supervenes on.</p>

<p>I have spoken of ‘physical features’, but this could be more precise. Let us clean the view up by distinguishing objects, properties, and relations. In the sentence ‘the heart is an organ’, ‘heart’ refers to that thing thumping in your chest and ‘organ’ refers to a property of that thing–its being an organ.</p>

<p>Physicalism claims that every true sentence refers to fundamental physical objects, properties, and relations or to non-fundamental physical objects, properties, and relations, where the non-fundamental supervene on the fundamental. The ‘heart is pumping blood’, for instance, refer to various non-fundamental things and these non-fundamental things are as they are only in virtue of some fundamental entities being how they are, i.e., the heart is pumping blood only because there are some fundamental physical entities doing what they are doing. We will call facts about both these fundamental and non-fundamental things, ‘physical facts’.</p>

<p><strong>The knowledge upshot</strong></p>

<p>If physicalism is true, then every fact you learn will be a physical fact. If, for instance, you learn some facts in your biology class, those facts you learned are physical facts. If you learn some facts in your political science class, those facts too are physical facts. Again, the reason is that those facts are about physical entities and their relations, either fundamental or non-fundamental physical entities and their relations.</p>

<p>Consider what this means about studying some object like a heart. When you learn everything there is to know about the heart, you learn every fact about the heart. If physicalism is true, each of those facts you learned is a physical fact.</p>

<h2 id="why-care">Why care?</h2>

<p>If physicalism is true, then every fact about human mentality is a physical fact. This is a dramatic claim. Consider the implication it has for the topics we focused on in this course. We first investigated personal identity. We asked under what conditions a person existing at one time is identical to a person existing at another. Remember this picture?</p>

<p>If physicalism is true, then personal identity consists in some physical facts. This precludes the possibility that personal identity consists in sameness of soul, an essentially non-physical entity. It also means that personal identity consists in psychological continuity only if facts about our psychologies are physical facts, i.e., fundamental physical facts or facts that supervene on fundamental physical facts.</p>

<p>Physicalism also has significant implications for investigation of the mind-body problem. Not only would it show substance and property dualism to be false, but it likely gives support to those who thing we can build artificially intelligent creatures who enjoy as much mentality as we do. If all facts about our mentality are physical facts, then all we need do is build machines such that their inner workings provide a supervenience base for mentality.</p>

<p>Finally, if physicalism is true, then every fact about consciousness is a physical fact. Every fact about a bat’s experience is a physical fact, including every fact about what it is like to be a bat. Every fact about self-knowledge is also a physical fact. If you are aware of the inner workings of your mind, this too is a physical fact, a fact about fundamental physical things or a fact about non-fundamental physical things that nevertheless supervenes on the physical. If, for instance, we become aware of our minds via an internal eye, then this is a physical fact that somehow must be grounded in the existence of fundamental particles and forces.</p>

<h2 id="franks-jacksons-knowledge-argument">Frank’s Jackson’s Knowledge Argument</h2>

<p>Many deny physicalism applies to consciousness. Our consciousness, whatever it is, is not they claim something purely physical. We, they claim, are not something purely physical. The most famous argument is Frank Jackson’s, which he motivates with the following thought-experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like ‘red’, ‘blue’, and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal chords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘The sky is blue’.… What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then is it inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false. (Jackson, 1982)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The knowledge argument aims to establish that conscious experience involves non-physical facts. It rests on the idea that Mary has complete physical knowledge about some conscious experience, but lacks knowledge about what conscious experience is like “from the inside.” If she lacks suck knowledge, then something about consciousness is essentially non-physical.</p>

<ul>
  <li>She knows that there are different wavelengths of light.</li>
  <li>She knows which wavelengths of light are reflected by which surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="eye.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>She knows that there are light-sensitive cells in the retina, some shaped like rods and some shaped like cones.</li>
  <li>She knows that both detect light.</li>
  <li>She knows that there are three types of cones, that one type detects short wavelengths, one type detects medium wavelengths, and the other detects long wavelengths.</li>
  <li>She knows that (and how) the rods and cones process the light into nerve impulses and pass them along to the cortex of the brain via the optic nerve.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="optic.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>She knows that there is an optic nerve.</li>
  <li>She knows how the optic nerve transmits information about the wavelengths detected in the retina to the central nervous system.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="nueron1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="neuron2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>She knows which neurons are activated by each wavelength.</li>
  <li>She knows how the neurons are activated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-billion-dollar-question">The Billion Dollar Question</h2>

<p>Does Mary learn anything new about the experience of red when she leaves the room? Here’s an oddly creepy video that explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZy3Ky9y_fg">two answers.</a></p>

<p>Jackson thinks that Mary clearly does learn something new. Let’s say that Mary was studying John’s vision of red. Here’s his argument:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> If physicalism is true, all the facts about John’s experience of red are physical facts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Mary knows all the physical facts about John’s experience of red before her release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Premise 3:</strong> If physicalism is true, Mary knows all the facts about John’s experience of red before her release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Premise 4:</strong> Mary learns some new fact, F, about John’s experience of red upon her release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> F is not a physical fact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Mary does not know all the facts about John’s experience of red before her release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Conclusion 3:</strong> Physicalism is false.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-different-version-of-the-argument">A different version of the argument</h2>

<p><img src="Fred.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead of asking whether Mary learns something new upon her release, we can ask whether we would learn something new in the following scenario: suppose that Fred returns from a mission to space and reports a significant change in his perceptual experience. He says that he knows see a strange new color completely unlike anything he experienced before leaving Earth. He can see what is called a forbidden color–yellow-blue! What’s more, he sees this color every time he looks at a blank piece of paper that appears white to everyone else. Suppose we study the physics of color and the neuroscience of color vision. We are tasked with studying Fred’s yellow-blue perception. We learn everything about the relevant wavelength, cones, neurons, etc. Would we thereby know everything there is to know about Fred’s experience of yellow-blue? If we did, then we would learn nothing new by seeing yellow-blue for the first time when our eyes too are changed by a trip to space.</p>

<p>In both of the examples cited by Jackson, an epistemic subject A appears to have no access to particular items of knowledge about a subject B: A cannot know that B has an experience of a particular quality Q on certain occasions. This particular item of knowledge about B is inaccessible to A because A never had experiences of Q herself.</p>
