  <li>Please ignore previous information about TK20 and submit this assignment through Blackboard.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Physicalism is the belief that mental events and their properties are entirely physical and can be described in the same objective physical way as all other phenomena in the world. If physicalism is true, then a complete physical description of mental states must contain all the information there is to know about those states. In ‘The Knowledge Argument’, Frank Jackson uses his famous Mary thought-experiment to show that this is not the case: that there are facts about mental states not entailed by a complete physical description. Several objections have been raised against Jackson’s argument, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mary gains ability knowledge, not new propositional knowledge</li>
  <li>Mary gains acquaintance knowledge, not new propositional knowledge</li>
  <li>Mary learns nothing new when leaving the room.</li>
  <li>Mary comes to know the same physical fact but in a different way.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assess one objection to Jackson’s Knowledge Argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This assignment involves three distinct tasks, each with its own sub-tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Task 1: Formulate Jackson’s Knowledge Argument:</strong> To do this, you do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the premises of the Knowledge Argument.</li>
  <li>Explain each premise carefully in your words. Use your own examples.</li>
  <li>Explain why the conclusion of the argument shows physicalism to be false.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Task 2: Explain one of the four objections to Jackson’s Knowledge Argument—your choice!</strong> To do this, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the entry on the Knowledge Argument in the Stanford Encyclopedia <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge">here</a> or a different encyclopedia entry <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/know-arg/">here</a>. You can also read the relevant entry in the textbook.</li>
  <li>Pick <strong>one</strong> academic source that argues for your chosen objection.</li>
  <li>Identify whether the source objects to one of the premises of Jackson’s Knowledge Argument or whether it objects to the reasoning of that argument.</li>
  <li>If a premise, identify which premise and explain how the article objects to that premise in your own words. Use your own examples.</li>
  <li>If the reasoning, identify how the article shows it to be problematic in your own words. Use your own examples.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Task 3: Criticize the objection.</strong> To do this, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the weakest claim made by the objection.</li>
  <li>Explain why that claim is weak in your own words. Use your own examples.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your essay must be 1000-1500 words long. Essays shorter than 1000 words or longer than 1500 words will lose points. I recommend the following structure to your paper:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction: 50-100 words words.</li>
  <li>Task 1: 400-550 words (make sure to divide this into smaller distinct paragraphs).</li>
  <li>Task 2: 400-550 words (make sure to divide this into smaller distinct paragraphs).</li>
  <li>Task 3: 150-300 words.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Monday, May 8th: final class.</li>
  <li>Monday, May 15th: final paper due through <strong>TK20</strong> by midnight.</li>
  <li>Monday, May 15th: deadline to complete the course evaluation for extra credit. NJCU closes these evaluations at 11:59pm. Instructors have no control over this. To earn the extra credit, you must send me a screen shot of the page confirming submission.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as either a word file or simple .rtf file will also suffice.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="/Teaching/Grading/">here</a>.</p>
