\section{Catalog Description}

This course introduces students to the philosophical study of mind. Students will learn how their unique psychologies play a role in distinguishing themselves from others, as well as consider how their psychologies are shaped by their environment and biology. The course also focuses on the relationship between mind and body.

\section{Course Description}

The primary goal of the course is to make students aware of their mental lives and the significance their mental lives have on questions about personal identity and naturalism. It will serve majors and minors in Philosophy and Religion as well as the wider student population. It introduces the former to the philosophical study of mind, which will serve as a spring-board to higher-level courses in mind, the philosophy of psychology, and related issues in epistemology and metaphysics. For the latter, the course will offer the opportunity to analyze the ways in which their unique psychologies shape who and what they are, and, at the same time, offer the opportunity to analyze the ways in which their psychologies are affected by their biology and environment. 

The course also promises to teach students to be tolerant in three distinct ways. First, questions about whether the mind can be explained by the natural sciences is key to deciding the scope of natural science, and, by extension, the nature of the reality we inhabit. The study of mind thus serves as a useful bulwark against an over-confidence in current scientific paradigms. Second, questions about whether, and to what extent, animals have mental states has been taken as key to deciding what if any moral status they enjoy. The study of mind thus serves as a bulwark against speciesism. Third, questions about the nature of psychological traits are key to deciding whether, and how, our environment determines how we act. Thus the study of mind makes students aware of how the actions of their fellow citizens are affected by their environment, not merely their intrinsic features. 

\section{Learning Objectives}

Upon completing this course, students will be able to  (i) identify their own psychological characteristics, (ii) interpret readings ranging from newspaper articles to literary and philosophical texts, as well as artworks and movies, (iii) define fundamental philosophical ideas and concepts, (iv) compare different theories of the mind, (v) apply these theories to settles questions of survival and mentality,  and  (vi) manage their studies in a responsible and timely manner.
