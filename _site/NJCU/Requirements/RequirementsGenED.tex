\section*{General Education vs. General Studies}
NJCU transitioned to a new General Education Program in Fall 2015. Students who enrolled in NJCU before that date were participating in the General Studies Program, whose courses have been replaced. Please consult an advisor in the Philosophy/Religion Department on how to substitute courses from one program for the other. Please also discuss with an advisor any other substitutions that might be needed to satisfy these major requirements.  

\section*{Courses by Area}

Please consult the below table to identify the courses that will satisfy the various distribution requirements. Note the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The course list for each semester will clearly identify which courses will satisfy distribution requirements in that semester. 
\item Not every course that is offered or will be offered is listed below. 
\item Depending on the content of a particular course, some courses might satisfy more than one area requirement. This will be clearly stated on the relevant semester's course list. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Prerequisites}
Successfully completing ENGL 101 is a prerequisite for all courses at the 200 level or above that are \emph{not} part of the General Education program.
