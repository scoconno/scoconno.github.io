<h2 id="accurate-clocks">Accurate clocks</h2>

<p><img src="cong.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Clocks count some event that occurs at regular intervals, e.g., they count the swings of a pendulum, or the grains of sand falling down the hourglass. Call whatever clocks count ‘ticks’. The duration between ticks should be the same duration.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Congruence:</dt>
  <dd>If duration A and duration B are the same duration, then A and B are congruent.</dd>
  <dt>Synchrony:</dt>
  <dd>Two clocks are synchronized if a) they agree on the time, and b) tick at the same rate, i.e., if the durations between the respective ticks they count is congruent.</dd>
  <dt>Precision:</dt>
  <dd>A clock is precise if its replicas remain synchronized with one another.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong> is something different. Intuitively, an accurate clock is one that judges two durations of time as congruent only when they are congruent, i.e., only when they are of the same duration. In practice, clocks are considered accurate only when they are synchronized with the standard clock:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A perfectly <strong>accurate</strong> non-standard clock shows that it is time t just when the standard clock shows that it is time t.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-standard-clock">The Standard Clock</h2>

<p>Every clock measures some process. What process should the standard clock measure? Would any of these suffice? Why not?</p>

<p><img src="sand.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="pend.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="earth.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions?</p>

<h2 id="our-current-standard-clock">Our current standard clock</h2>

<p>Today, our standard clock is based on the rate of decay of cesium. The basic idea is to use the radiation emitted from this type of atom as the regular process by which to define our standard clock. Here is a depiction of an atomic clock:</p>

<p><img src="atomic.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The clock is able to detect the radiation emitted by the cesium and translate it into a measure of time. A tick of the atomic clock is just the period, called an oscillation and vibration, of a certain kind of radiation emitted by the cesium. A standard second has been defined as 9,192,631,770 of these periods. If all of this is too complicated, just think of an atomic clock like this:</p>

<p><img src="simple.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Think of a standard second as 9,192,631,770 shakes of this crystal. A non-standard clock is accurate if it registers the same time as a standard clock, i.e., your wristwatch is accurate only if it says, say, that 10 seconds have passed just when the atomic clock says that 10 seconds have passed (where 10 seconds just means 10*9,192,631,770 ‘shakes’.)</p>

<p>But what does it mean for the atomic clock, now our standard, clock to be accurate? Surely, it is accurate only if the durations between the ticks it measures are congruent. But what does it mean for those durations to be congruent other than the fact tje clock registers them as congruent?</p>

<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>

<p>Consider the relationship between various measurement devices and what they measure:</p>

<p><img src="dist.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>We can see the heights we wish to measure. Likewise, we can hear the notes whose pitch we wish to measure. But can we see, hear, touch or in anyway directly perceive the time we use clocks to measure? Consider our some simple clocks:</p>

<p><img src="sand.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="pend.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>These clocks measure the passage of time via a certain change. We use the flow of sand, or the swing of the pendulum, to indicate to us that time is passing. If the process is regular, we assume the clocks are ticking along accurately with the flow of time. But how can we know that the process is regular unless we have direct access to time? Even if we judge our pendulum clock’s accuracy by comparing its time to the time of the atomic clock, how can we judge the accuracy of the atomic clock without some further process to compare the atomic clock to?</p>

<p>The problem is this: it seems we could only truly assess the accuracy of a standard clock if we could access time itself, not any process or change, but all we have direct access to are processes and change. This problem has two radically different philosophical answers:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Conventionalism:</dt>
  <dd>Two given successive durations are congruent because the clock we chose as our standard registers them as congruent.</dd>
  <dt>Objectivism:</dt>
  <dd>Two given successive durations are congruent regardless of whether the clock we chose as our standard registers them as congruent. And, while we can have good reasons for judging that two durations are congruent, we cannot really know that they are congruent.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Consider the value of $10. Its value is merely a matter of convention, a convention of what we as society are willing to exchange goods and services for. Consider the fact that 5+5=10. It is matter of convention what words and symbols we use for these numbers. But it is not a matter of convention that the numbers referred to with these symbols have the value they do. Likewise, objectivists say that it is not a matter of convention whether two durations are congruent (though it is obviously a matter of convention what names we give to various durations of time). The conventionalist says that congruency is a matter of convention. Once we stipulate that a clock is a standard one, nothing else can be said.</p>

<h2 id="arguments-for-conventionalism">Arguments for Conventionalism</h2>

<p>One argument for conventionalism is offered by verificationism, a position in the philosophy of language. The view was often articulated with the slogan of one of its proponents, Schlick, who claimed the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The meaning of a statement consists in its method of verification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So also A.J Ayer in ‘Language, Truth and Logic’ claimed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sentence is only factually significant to a person if he or she knows what observations would lead him to accept the proposition as being true or false…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No statement which refers to a reality transcending the limits of all possible sense-experience can possible have any literal significance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is that sentences, at least those that are true or false, have clearly identifiable tests of their truth. Consider, for instance, ‘the cat is on the mat’. This sentence is either true or false. I might not currently know if the sentence is true. I might be in the coffee shop unaware of what my cat is doing. Nevertheless, I know what observations could settle the matter. If I were to walk into my apartment and observe a grey, 12lb cat, breathing and sitting on a mat, I would know that the sentence is true. If I observe no creature on the mat, the sentence is false. Verificationists claim that sentences are meaningful only if there are possible observable tests of their truth; they even claim that the meaning of a sentence consists in these verification conditions, i.e., consists in these observations that prove the sentence true or false.</p>

<p>My sentence about the cat was an easy one. The observations that verify it are straightforward and clearly connected to cats and mats. But the observations that verify a sentence can be more elaborate and indirect. For instance, many of the sentences in physics are verified by what you might consider indirect observations. We may not be able to see subatomic particles directly, but we can observe the tracks they make in a cloud chamber like this:</p>

<p><img src="cloud.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So, the observations that verify sentences about subatomic particles will likely be observations about their effects, i.e., the sentence ‘a sub-atomic particle A has P’ is verified by some observation about the ionized gas particle in the cloud chamber.</p>

<p>Don’t worry too much about this example from physics. I include it only to stress that verificationism allows for many subtle and indirect observations to verify a sentence; they don’t think a term is meaningful only if you can directly see what it refers to.  You might indirectly see its referent by, for instance, seeing what effects the thing has. What is important is that 1) there are some clearly identifiable observations that would verify these sentences, 2) these observations are in principle possible by everyone–something is confirmable only if in principle confirmable by everyone, and 3) the meaning of a sentence consists in the set of these observations that prove it true or false.</p>

<p>Verificationism has an obvious upshot: if no observation can verify a sentence, the sentence is meaningless. And, by ‘meaningless’, I mean it is a string of sounds as meaningful as, say, ‘blah wah doo efle fople wittle.’ That’s obviously a non-sensical string of words. If no observation could confirm a sentence, the verificationist claims that sentence is similarly non-sensical. There are interesting questions about how to understand sentences about God according to verificationism. But we can set that aside and focus on the relevance  verificationism has for our topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1. The meaning of a sentence is given by the conditions that must be verified to obtain if the sentence is true–call these <em>verification conditions.</em></li>
  <li>P2. If ‘the standard clock is accurate’ is meaningful, then the sentence has verification conditions.</li>
  <li>P3. Verification conditions must be publicly observable.</li>
  <li>P4. No observation can verify that the standard clock is accurate.</li>
  <li>C. Sentences about the accuracy of the standard clock are meaningless, i.e., neither true nor false.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="arguments-for-objectivism">Arguments for Objectivism</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08BFCZJDn9w"><img src="newton.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Newton’s First and Second Laws:
1. A body continues in a state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by a force.
2. The acceleration of a body is a function of its mass and the force acting upon it, such that Force = Mass x Acceleration.</p>

<p>Both make implicit reference to congruent durations. Why?</p>

<p><img src="car.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Suppose that we base our standard clock on the rotation of the Earth. One 24 hour period passes just when the Earth turns fully on its axis. 1 hour is that duration it takes the Earth to rotate 1/24th of its rotation. Compare two scenarios.</p>

<p>Scenario 1: our car travel 120 mph for 30 minutes. It has thereby travelled 60 miles.</p>

<p>Scenario 2: the Earth is hit by a large asteroid and its rate of spin doubles. Suppose an exact replica of the car in exactly similar conditions travels 120 mph for 30 minutes. It has thereby travelled 60 miles.</p>

<p>Does 60 miles in scenario 1 = 60 miles in scenario 2?</p>
