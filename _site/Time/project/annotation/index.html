        <h1 id="what-is-an-annotated-bibliography">What is an annotated bibliography?</h1>

<p>An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and documents. Each citation is followed by a brief (usually about 150 words) descriptive and evaluative paragraph, the annotation.</p>

<p>The purpose of the annotation is to inform the reader of the relevance, accuracy, and quality of the sources cited. The idea here is that you are creating and collecting a small number of documents that you can then use to write your large research paper. We will focus on academic research about your chosen topic i.e., peer reviewed publications. Papers run normally about 30 pages. While books are obviously longer, you normally will be able to focus on one or two chapters for your project.</p>

<h1 id="the-process">The Process</h1>

<p>Creating an annotated bibliography calls for the application of a variety of intellectual skills: concise exposition, succinct analysis, and informed library research.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Locate and record citations to books, periodicals, and documents that may contain useful information and ideas on your topic. While you can use the library website, you should  also go into the library. If you locate a book you think is useful, look at the rest of the shelf. Often you will find other relevant material.
    <ol>
      <li><strong>NB:</strong> Use librarians! One of the main jobs of an academic librarian is to help users find research material. Tell them what you are interested in and they will help you figure out what to read.</li>
      <li>Digital resources are risky. There is as much inaccurate information as there is accurate information online. If you do use online resources, try to only use resources found through the libraryâ€™s website.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Briefly examine and review the actual items. You need to read them closely enough to decide whether they are relevant.</li>
  <li>Choose those works that are relevant and helpful for your topic. Discard those that are irrelevant.</li>
  <li>Of those you keep, cite the book, article, or document using the your preferred citation style, e.g., APA, Chicago, etc.</li>
  <li>Write a concise annotation that summarizes the central theme and scope of the work. Make sure to identify the main claim/question that interests you and write a very short summary of the work, where your summary picks up primarily on just whatever is relevant for your topic. If a source contains an answer to your chosen question, clearly state that answer and write a few sentences about the evidence given in support of it. You may also compare or contrast the various works you have cited, e.g., work A defends answer X, but work B rejects answer X and argues for answer Y.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Your annotated bibliography must include <strong>citations</strong> amd <strong>annotations</strong> for <strong>three</strong> peer reviewed sources concerning your topic. Write    150-250 words for each annotation, 450-750 words total.</p>
