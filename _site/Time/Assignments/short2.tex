\subsection{Short Essay 1}\label{short-essay-1}

\subsubsection{Prompt}\label{prompt}

Stop the clock! News alert! The prominent scientist Edwin Hubble has
claimed to discover conclusive evidence that the Universe has a
beginning. It is being called in some quarters evidence that the
Universe began with a `Big Bang'. Others reject this wholeheartedly.
They claim that the evidence for the Big Bang shows only that the
Universe once experienced a `Big Crunch' before expanding once again, a
cycle of crunch, bang, crunch and so on that has and will go on for
eternity.

You are a journalist for the NY Times. Your editor sends you the
following assignment:

\begin{quote}
All this bang/crunch talk is getting those science folk in a tizzy. I
can't make heads or tails of it, but our readers want an explanation.
Please write a very accessible piece explaining the supposed evidence
for the Big Bang and the debate over whether it shows that the Universe
has a beginning. Make sure to explain the alternative of
bang/crunch/bang/crunch and so on .

And remember, we need to sell newspapers! When I say `accessible', I
mean that it better be understandable by your average joe, someone with
only a high school diploma.

If you make this simple enough, we might even give you a regular column!
\end{quote}
