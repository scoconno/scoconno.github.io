        <h2 id="our-experience-of-time">Our Experience of Time</h2>

<p>Watch a clock hand move. We seem to see this movement, an event that lasts some duration of time. But that perception may be illusionary. Many think we cannot perceive the duration of an event, a property that events do seem to have. Instead we seem to experience a sequence of independent and static snapshots of the clock hand’s motion. John Locke writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Body, though it really moves, [nevertheless] seems to stand still, as is evident in the Hands of Clocks, and Shadows of Sun-dials, and other constant, but slow Motions, where though after certain Intervals, we perceive by the change of distance, that it hath moved, yet the Motion itself we perceive not. (John Locke, <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>, Book II, chapter XIV, §11.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it certainly seems like we can experience time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]t is a notorious fact that we do not merely notice that something <em>has</em> moved or otherwise changed; we also often see something <em>moving</em> or <em>changing</em>. This happens if we look at the second-hand of a watch or look at a flickering flame. These are experiences of a quite unique kind; we could no more describe what we sense in them to a man who had never had such experiences than we could describe a red colour to a man born blind. It is also clear that to see a second-hand <em>moving</em> is a quite different thing from “seeing” that an hour-hand <em>has</em> moved. (C. D. Broad, <em>Scientific Thought</em>, p. 351.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Distinguish perceiving a duration of time from events that occurring the duration. We certainly cannot perceive the former. Our interest is whether we can perceive the latter. If not, we would like to know why it seems to us like we can experience these durations. Consider the famous blue/gold dress controversy. The interesting question is not what color the dress really is. The interesting question is how and why we experience the dress as having a color that it likely does not have.</p>

<p>Our experience of time has several features:
1. We experience various events in a particular order, e.g., we experience one event as occurring before a different event. Some believe that the length of time we experience an event occurring is determined by the time the correlated brain process occurs. Others claim it is not determined by the time the correlated brain process occurs, but in terms of some other feature of the brain processes.
2. We experience some events as simultaneous, even if they are not simultaneous. This is especially problematic as we may experience events 1 and 2 as simultaneous with one another, 2 and 3 as simultaneous with another, but 1 and 3 as not simultaneous with one another. This shows that experience of simultaneity is far removed from what, in fact, simultaneity really is.
3. We experience events to occur not merely at times but also through time, e.g., I experience some events as somehow in the presents as opposed the past.</p>

<p>We would like to know how our experiences could have these three features.</p>

<h2 id="two-possible-answers">Two Possible Answers</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><em>Specious Present Theory</em>:</dt>
  <dd>We directly perceive temporally extended events, e.g., we perceive more than just the exact present. On this view, we don’t merely experience snap shots of reality.</dd>
  <dt><em>Retention Theory</em>:</dt>
  <dd>Experience of reality is supplemented with memories from the past and anticipations of the future. The content of experience is not merely exhausted by the world we experience but also includes content, somehow, from us.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="specious-present">Specious Present</h3>

<p>How long is the present you experience?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he practically cognized present is no knife-edge, but a saddle-back, with a certain breadth of its own on which we sit perched, and from which we look in two directions into time. The unit of composition of our perception of time is a <em>duration</em>, with a bow and a stern, as it were – a rearward- and a forward-looking end… We do not first feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the perception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we seem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends embedded in it. (William James, <em>The Principles of Psychology</em>, Vol. I, pp. 609-10.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to James, we perceive not only what is <strong>now</strong> occurring but also with what <strong>has recently occurred</strong> and what is <strong>about to occur</strong> as well. Many today say it lasts less than 3 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong>
1. How can I be directly aware of something that is no longer taking place?
2. How can I be directly aware of a duration?
3. How can I be directly aware of the future?</p>

<h3 id="retention-theory">Retention Theory</h3>
<p>This view is often defended by empiricists who were generally interested in identifying the origin of all thought in our sense experience. The connection between some thoughts and reality is simple. The origin of my idea of cat comes from seeing cats. Other ideas do not seem to have such a direct connection to what we can experience, e.g., the thoughts about numbers . Empiricists claim that such thoughts are indirectly from what we can experience, e,g, they concern ideas that are formed from from association of ideas whose origin is from directly sensible things.  Succession and duration are meant to be like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea of time is not deriv’d from a particular impression mix’d up with others, and plainly distinguishable from them; but arises altogether from the manner, in which impressions appear to the mind, without making one of the number. Five notes play’d on a flute give us the impression and idea of time; tho’ time be not a sixth impression, which presents itself to the hearing or any other of the senses. (Hume, <em>Treatise</em>, pp. 34-5.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Empiricists claim that we get the idea of succession, of one thing following another, by just having a succession of ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A succession of feelings, in and of itself, is not a feeling of succession.” (William James, <em>Principles</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Williams objects that just notifying that ideas succeed one another is insufficient to generate the feeling of time passing.</p>

<p>Kant defends an alternative empiricist approach. He claims that I do not only have an experience of the thing before me now, but I also “reproduce in imagination” the things I experienced in the recent past. Unlike James, Kant does not claim we perceive the past or the future. He rather claims that we somehow reproduce them in imagination, e.g., remember the past.</p>

<p>One problem for Kant is to explain how and why I produce memories of being further or nearer to the present. Why do I remember the moment the clock struck 1pm as somehow more recent than the moment is was at 12:59? Two options are worth exploring here:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><em>Strength Model</em>:</dt>
  <dd>The time of an event is inferred from information about relations between the event in question, e.g., I infer the 1pm striking of the clock occurred later than the 12:59pm.</dd>
  <dt><em>Inference Model</em>:</dt>
  <dd>Memories of events very in strength based on how remote or near they are, where strength can be characterized in terms of vividness and detail.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="why-do-we-only-perceive-the-present">Why do we only perceive the present?</h2>

<p>I can see objects directly before me. I can also see those nearby as well as those far away. Our perception of time is not like this. I can experience the events that occur now, but I cannot experience events near or far time. Why is this?</p>
