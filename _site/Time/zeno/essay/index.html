  <h1 class="page-title">Essay</h1>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Zeno uses his Stadium Paradox to argue that motion is impossible in discrete space, i.e., to argue that it is impossible for an object to move if the distance it travels is divisible into a finite number of parts (each of which has some smallest length).</p>

<p>Let us assume that space is discrete, that any distance is finitely divisible into a finite number of smallest parts. How can we rescue motion from Zeno’s Stadium Paradox? What would motion have to be like in order for motion to be immune from the Stadium Paradox?</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Assume that space is discrete. This essay has two parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain the Stadium Paradox</li>
  <li>Try solve the paradox while maintaining the assumption that space is discrete. You <strong>cannot</strong> respond by saying that space is infinitely divisible.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB: Do not discuss any of the other paradoxes! This paper is only about the Stadium Paradox. Nothing else.</strong></p>

<h2 id="further-instruction">Further Instruction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use diagrams, illustrations, etc., to explain the paradox.</li>
  <li>We didn’t discuss possible solutions. This was by design. The second part of this exercise is asking you to think for yourself. It’s ok if your solution ultimately won’t work. I want you to try.</li>
  <li>Assume that your audience is bright, but not familiar with the topic. Explain the terminology you introduce.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>

<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>Submit your work by first clicking on the relevant assignment in Blackboard. Click on ‘browse computer’ and upload your document as a .doc, .rtf, or .pdf file. Please use ‘attach document’. Do not send it to me by e-mail or through Blackboard’s messaging application.</p>
