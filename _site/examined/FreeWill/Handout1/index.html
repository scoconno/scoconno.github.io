        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You likely think that you have control of your own destiny, that you have power over your future. You are free, you might think, to choose what to eat, who to date, and what career to pursue. It certainly does appear that way. When trying to decide between chocolate cake and a salad, it seems that I really do have it in my power to eat either of those things. If I eat the cake, I still could have eaten the salad and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>Many things that seem a certain way are not that way. Some of you, like me, may have believed passionately in the existence of Santa Clause when you were children. You later came to learn that you were mistaken. In this module, we will be considering whether our belief in free will might be like a belief in Santa Clause, wholly mistaken. If we do not have free will, then it was not in my power to eat the salad even though I thought that it was.</p>

<p>Why would anyone reject the existence of something that seems so obvious? A belief in free will is central to our democracies, to our criminal justice systems, even to many of our religious world views. But many have thought that free will jars with our understanding of the physical universe. They point out that our actions are part of a long chain of causes and effects. And it seems that the facts about the earliest parts of the chain in conjunction with the laws of nature determine exactly how the rest of the chain must go; I can’t choose my future because the past has already set it in stone.</p>

<h2 id="causal-determinism">Causal Determinism</h2>

<p>Our argument against free will relies on two claims, one a general claim that applies to all events in the universe, a second a claim about what free will would require of us.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Causal Determinism:</dt>
  <dd>Given a specified way things are at a time <em>t</em>, everything which happens at a time later than <em>t</em> is fixed as a matter of natural law.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Consider a rock falling down a side of a mountain on Mars this morning. That rock was set in motion by some preceding event, perhaps a rover hit and dislodged it. Causal determinism says that the entire state of the universe this morning, including that rock falling down the mountain, was completely determined by the state of the universe at any time before this morning plus the laws governing motion, gravity, etc. This might seem far-fetched. But that’s exactly what our scientific laws are; they determine how things will be in the future given how things are in the past. Suppose, then, there was a God like scientist. By knowing the state of the universe 1000 years ago plus all the rules governing our universe, our God-like scientist would know for certain that the rock was going to fall this morning.</p>

<p>The problem is that Causal Determinism seems to jar with a fairly ordinary sense of free will.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Free Will:</dt>
  <dd>An agent, S, freely chooses to do F at time <em>t1</em> if and only if it was S’s power at time <em>t1</em> to bring either F or not F about.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Suppose Mike Tyson force feeds me some cake. No-one would claim that I ate that cake freely. Since it was not in my power to not eat the cake, the eating was not in my power at all. Similarly, if you were forced to take a job, or forced to take a course, and it was not in your power to do otherwise, you would not be taking that job or pursuing that course of your own free will. If you don’t have the power to do otherwise, then it was never in your power in the first place. The problem is that Causal Determinism seems to say that it is never in our power to do otherwise:</p>

<p><em>Argument Against Free Will</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>If a person acts of her own free will, then she could have done otherwise.</li>
  <li>If determinism is true, no one can do otherwise than one actually does.</li>
  <li>Therefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free will.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key premise is 2. Recall that causal determinism says that states of the universe, including what you are doing at any particular time, are completely determined by how the universe was in the past, even the far far past, plus the laws of nature. If that’s true, then my eating the cake was causally determined, it is already set in stone. In that case, I had no power to not eat the cake. Causal determinism constrains my actions as much as Mike Tyson constrains my cake-eating.</p>

<p>Philosophers have been concerned with determining, first, whether causal determinism is really true, and, second, with determining whether free will really is incompatible with causal determinism. There are four main positions:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Free Will is Not Possible</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Free Will is Possible</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Causal Determinism is true</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Hard Determinism</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">Compatibilism</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Causal Determinism is false</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Hard Indeterminism</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">Libertarianism</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="compatibilism">Compatibilism</h2>

<p>Recall the Free Will Problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a person acts of her own free will, then she could have done otherwise.</li>
  <li>If determinism is true, no one can do otherwise than one actually does.</li>
  <li>Therefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free will.</li>
</ol>

<p>Causal determinism says that states of the universe, including what you are doing at any particular time, are completely determined by how the universe was in the past, even the far far past, plus the laws of nature. If that is true, then my eating  cake right now was causally determined, it was already set in stone that I would eat it and I had no power to do otherwise.  Our concern in this handout is compatibilism, which tries to reconcile this fact about our actions with free will. It does so by rejecting premise 1 of the above argument.</p>

<p>While the compatibilist accepts causal determinism, they claim that humans are still morally responsible for their behavior and deserving of blame and punishment. If a person is morally responsible for their behavior, then they must be the source of their own conduct. Compatibilists offer an account of what it means for us to be the source of our own conduct that is supposedly compatible with causal determinism. The first move in motivating compatibilism is to distinguish between two notions of ‘free will’.</p>

<p><strong>Forking Path view of Free Will (rejected by compatibilists)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An agent has control over her conduct at a moment in time if she has the ability to select among, or choose between, alternative courses of action, i.e., choose between alternative future paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>This forking path view of freedom jars with causal determinism. But the compatibilist denies that freedom should be understood along these lines. They instead offer the following account of freedom:</p>

<p><strong>Source of Action</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An agent freely does F if 1) F arises from her internal states and character, and 2) are not forced by external conditions or agents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose that I have a very sweet tooth. My having a sweet tooth will cause me to eat the cake. So that action, my eating the cake, in some strong sense comes from me and not the outside; it’s because of how I am that I ate the cake. The compatibilist claims that this is all that is required for an action to be free—it arises from inside of you, from your personality, and is not caused by external pressure.</p>

<p>How do actions arise from our personality? Our personality is made up a variety of different traits like honesty, courage, greed, etc. Some people are honest and courageous. Some are honest, but cowardly. Traits are complex dispositions to think, desire, and act in characteristic ways. To be honest, for instance, is to be disposed to truth-telling, to think well of those who tell the truth, to deliberate about whether you are communicated truthfully, and to act to rectify any possible confusion, e.g., contact someone to ensure you answered their questions truthfully.</p>

<p>Character traits have the following three features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Robust: an individual with a particular character trait will exhibit trait-relevant behavior across a broad spectrum of trait-relevant situations. Such traits are said to be “robust” traits, e.g., an honest person will tend to tell the truth to friends, family members, co-workers, students, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stabile: traits are relatively stable over time.  A soldier who behaves courageously for a significant period of time is courageous. A soldier who behaves non-courageously for a significant period of time is not courageous. A soldier will not become or cease to be courageous overnight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrated: there is a correlation between having one trait and having another, e.g., a person who is temperate with regard to the pleasures derived from food is likely to also be temperate with regard to the pleasures derived from sexual intercourse. Likewise, an individual with a particular vice is likely to possess other vices.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The compatibilist is committed to the claim that we have character traits that are robust, stable, and integrated with one another. They believe that an action is our own just when it arises from our unique set of traits; if my character traits make me eat the cake, then eating the cake, according to the compatibilist, is free.</p>
