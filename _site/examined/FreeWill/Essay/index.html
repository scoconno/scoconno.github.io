        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You are a psychologist for the NJ court system. Your job is to psychologically assess defendants. You must determine whether they committed the crime of their own free will. You primarily ask why the person has the character traits they have and ask whether their behavior is determined by those character traits. You interview their friends, family, and colleagues. You find out whatever you can about their upbringing and how it shaped the person they are today. You then write a short report to the judge outlining your findings. The odd twist is that today you are determined to prove that the defendant’s character is responsible for their action and that they had <strong>no control</strong> over having that character.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to teach you about free will and compatibilism.</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Write the psychological report outlining your results about the defendant.The report must have the following parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A description of the crime.
    <ul>
      <li>Identify some crime and prepare the psychological report of the defendant for the court.</li>
      <li>You can find a case by looking at old newspapers. NJ.com and nytimes.com are good places to start.</li>
      <li>Include details about the crime, the victim, and the behavior of the defendant. Make details up if you need to.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A description of the defendant’s personality.
    <ul>
      <li>Explain the defendant’s main character traits.</li>
      <li>Use anecdotes that illustrate these traits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An argument that the defendant’s upbringing caused them to have these character traits:
    <ul>
      <li>Do this by summarizing your interviews with the defendant’s family and friends. Provide examples from the defendant’s childhood that shaped their character.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An argument that the crime was caused by the defendant’s character.
    <ul>
      <li>Identify which character traits caused the defendant to commit the crime.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include any of these parts will lose you points.</p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>
<p>Your dialog must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. As the policies also state, there are no make-ups or extra credit opportunities. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Please submit the file as either a word, rtf, or pdf file.</p>
