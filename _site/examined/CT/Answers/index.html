<h2 id="stop">Stop</h2>

<p>Are you reading this document before trying the exercises yourself? Acquiring critical thinking skills requires some mental exercise along the way. Think of playing a video game. You could get a cheat key to work your way easily through a level, but you’ll never master the game. So if you had difficulty with any of the exercises, I encourage you to read Ch 1.3 again, look at my notes, and then try work out the answers by yourself before turning here.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>

<p>Recall that statements are assertions that something is or is not the case. They are always either true or false.</p>

<p><strong>Statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You are not a liar.</li>
  <li>You should never hit your mother with a shovel.</li>
  <li>The best explanation for his behavior is that he was in a trance.</li>
  <li>Rap music is better than punk rock.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Non-Statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Is God all-powerful?…this is a question. It does not assert that God is one way or the other.</li>
  <li>Turn that music off…this is a command. It does not assert that something is or is not the case.</li>
  <li>Great balls of fire!…this is an exclamation. It does not assert that something is or is not the case.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>

<p>Here are some more examples:</p>

<p><strong>Statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I will eat turkey tonight.</li>
  <li>There are 19 planets…(NB: not all statements are true. This sentence is an assertion that something is the case, i.e., that there are 19 planets. Even though it is false, it is still a statement.)</li>
  <li>The Sea Hawks are better than the Broncos.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Non-statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What will I eat tonight?</li>
  <li>Go Yankees!</li>
  <li>What meaning does life have?</li>
  <li>Close the door.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h2>

<p>‘P’=’premise’
‘C’=’conclusion’</p>

<p><strong>Argument 1</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: If Arme is in town, then she’s staying at the Barbary Hotel.</li>
  <li>P2: Arme is in town.</li>
  <li>C: Arme is staying at the Barbary Hotel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Argument 2</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: Banning assault rifles violates a constitutional right.</li>
  <li>C: The U.S. government should not ban assault rifles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Argument 3</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: Any movie with clowns in it cannot be a good movie.</li>
  <li>P2: Last night’s movie had at least a dozen clowns in it.</li>
  <li>C: The movie last night was awful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h2>

<p><strong>Passage 1</strong> does contain an argument:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: The GAO says that any weapon that costs more than $50 million apiece will actually impair our military readiness.</li>
  <li>P2: We should never impair our readiness.</li>
  <li>P3: The cost of the new XJ fighter plane is $650 million dollars.</li>
  <li>P4: The cost of three AR21 fighter bombers is $1.2 billion.</li>
  <li>C: The administration should cancel the XJ fighter plane project and the AR21 project.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Passage 2</strong> does not contain an argument. It merely asserts, in a somewhat dogmatic tone, that the cause of underage drinking is the marketing of alcohol, tobacco, and sex to children. There is no evidence provided for this assertion.</p>

<p><strong>Passage 3</strong> does not contain an argument. The writer claims that the requirement for church and state to be separate doesn’t require a ban on public prayer. But the rest of the passage gives no argument for that claim. We are told that the US is the greatest country and that it was founded on Christian beliefs. But that is not relevant in assessing whether separation of church and state requires banning prayer in public places, the issue in question.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-5">Exercise 5</h2>

<p><strong>Passage 1:</strong> The conclusion is buried half way through the passage. The premises come in the second half:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: In some of your letters to a friend you admitted that you were misleading me.</li>
  <li>P2: You’ve been telling everyone that we are just friends, not lovers.</li>
  <li>P3: You’ve been secretly dating someone else.</li>
  <li>C: Everything that you’ve told me regarding our relationship has been a lie.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Passage 2:</strong> there is an argument here, but there is lots of waffle that is distracting. The argument boils down to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: The news media are not in the business of endorsing or validating lifestyles.</li>
  <li>C: The news media should never (explicitly or implicitly) endorse lifestyles by announcing those lifestyles to the world.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-6">Exercise 6</h2>

<p><strong>Argument 1:</strong> Valid. The two premises are true. Since the argument is both valid and has true premises, the argument is also sound.</p>

<p><strong>Argument 2:</strong> Invalid. Just because most politicians are dishonest, it does not follow that Bill Clinton is dishonest—he may be one of the few honest politicians.</p>

<p><strong>Argument 3:</strong> Invalid. While the conclusion is true, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.</p>

<p><strong>Argument 4:</strong> Valid. Is it sound? We can’t tell from just the information provided. We would need to find out who each person is and also what street they live on. Again, we can always tell the validity of an argument by just assessing the structure of the argument provided. But we cannot always tell if the argument is sound by just the information provided. Often we have to further research the premises to determine whether they true or false.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-7">Exercise 7:</h2>

<p><strong>Sound:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: If x is a square, x has four equal straight sides.</li>
  <li>P2: If x has four equal straight sides, then x has four right angles.</li>
  <li>C: If x is a square, then x has four right equal angles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Valid, but not sound:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: All humans are from Mars.</li>
  <li>P2: Sandy is a human.</li>
  <li>C: Sandy is from Mars.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Invalid:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: All humans are mortal.</li>
  <li>P2: Socrates is mortal.</li>
  <li>C: Socrates is human.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> It might surprise you that this last argument is invalid. After all, the premises and conclusion are each true. Nevertheless, while the premises and conclusion are true, you cannot infer the conclusion just from the premises. No premise states that Socrates is human, so we can’t rule out the possibility that he’s a dog, or a dolphin, or any other mortal creature. The important lesson here is that assessing arguments requires you to assess the structure of <strong>exactly</strong> the argument provided. It’s not your job to supply information that would make the argument a good one.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-8">Exercise 8</h2>

<p><strong>Strong Inductive Arguments</strong></p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: The vast majority of people like cilantro.</li>
  <li>C: Sarah probably likes cilantro.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: The vast majority of dogs have four legs.</li>
  <li>P2: Fido is a dog.</li>
  <li>C: Fido probably has four legs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Weak Inductive Arguments</strong></p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: Not many people dislike chocolate.</li>
  <li>P2: Charlie is a person.</li>
  <li>C: Charlie probably dislikes chocolate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: The sun rose yesterday.</li>
  <li>C: The sun will probably rise tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> This last argument may surprise you. After all, the sun will rise tomorrow. But note that this argument is only providing one piece of evidence for the conclusion, namely, that the sun rose yesterday. This is very different from claiming that since the sun has risen on countless days before today, that it will likely rise tomorrow. In general, just because something happens once (as the premise reports), it does not follow that it is likely to happen again.</p>
