        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Finally! Rumors have circulated for months. It seems like the real thing this time. An intelligent computer! You have dreamed of this ever since you decided to enter the AI Detection Service. Not only might there finally be a computer that can pass that damn Turing Test, but you will be the one that gets to administer the test. How lucky for you that you were asked to investigate. You better not mess up like that newbie from last year did. He claimed the machine he was investigating was intelligent, but it turned out a hoax. That kid got fired when the results were checked. You are not going to make that mistake. You will administer the most thorough and professional Turing Test to date.</p>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Write a transcript of the dialog between you and the machine you are investigating. (You might model the transcript on a sample conversation you have with <a href="http://www.cleverbot.com/">cleverbot</a>). To successfully complete this assignment, your dialog must have the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sufficiently varied and realistic questions–the kinds of questions we normally ask each other in conversation.</li>
  <li>Answers that are sufficiently realistic and complex—the kinds of answers we normally give in conversations.</li>
  <li>Some tricky questions that might determine if the machine is intelligent.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will result in a loss of points.</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charitably explaining arguments for views that are not your own.</li>
  <li>Explaining difficult concepts in your own words.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your essay must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="/Teaching/Grading/">here</a>.</p>
