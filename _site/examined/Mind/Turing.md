The following six were raised and discussed by Turing himself. 

1.  The argument from extrasensory perception
2.  The argument from various disabilities
3.  The argument from consciousness
4.  The mathematical Objection
5.  Argument from the informality of behavior
6.  Lady Lovelace’s objection


### Argument from Various Disabilities

Objection
> Machines cannot do many things that humans can, e.g.,be kind, be resourceful, be beautiful, be friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behavior as a man, do something really new.

Response: The objection relies on an inductive inference. You know that particular machines have various disabilities and then infer that all present and future machines will have various disabilities. But induction can fail!

+  Induction is a non-deductive inference. We infer that since some instances of a certain group have a certain attribute that the next members of that group will have that attribute.
	+   The sun rose every day that I remember, hence, the sun will rise tomorrow.
	+   Every lion I have seen was a golden yellow color, hence every lion I will see will be a golden yellow color.

The Problem with Induction inferences is that they are difficult to justify. 


### The Argument from Consciousness

Objection

> “Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain—that is, not only write it but know that it had written in it.”

1.  A being can think only if it can know that it thinks.

2.  Computers cannot know that they think.

3.  Computers cannot think. (From 1 and 2)

Response: Reject 2

1.  The evidence we could have that a being is self-aware is either from their reports or from being that being.
2.  We cannot be another being.
3.  So the only evidence we have that another being is self-aware is their reports that they are self-aware. (From 1&2)
4.  Computers can report that they are self-aware. (From performance in Turing Test)
5.  So we have evidence that they are self-aware. (From 3&4)

In addition, if the machine gave sufficiently complex answers about how it wrote poetry, we would likely think that it is, in fact, conscious.

### The Mathematical Objection

Objection

1.  Within any consistent formal system there are statements that can neither be proved nor disproved within that system.
2.  Suppose that a computing machine is a formal system that operates by proving or disproving various statements put to it, i.e., by answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to various questions put to it.
3.  There will be questions a computing machine gives wrong answers to   (From 1 and 2; the machine, in some cases, should say that there is no correct answer.)
4.  Intelligent beings are not so limited.
5.  A computing machine is not intelligent. (From 3 and 4)

Response: Reject 4

1.  There are questions that humans can’t answer, yet they are
    intelligent.
2.  It could be that the inability to answer every question is due to precisely the same limitations that restrict the capacity of machines.

### Objection from the Informality of Behavior

Objection

> If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines.

Response: Distinguish

Laws of Conduct:
:   Precepts such as “Stop if you see red lights,” on which one 	can act, and of which one can be conscious.

Laws of Behavior:
:   Laws of nature as applied to a man’s body such as “if you pinch him  he will squeak.” (We do not act upon these laws, nor is it important that we are conscious of them.)

Turing agrees that if there is a definite set of laws of behavior that regulate X’s life, then x is a machine. But he denies that being regulated by laws of conduct are relevant for determining if X is a machine.

He then argues that humans are as much machines as computers. He agrees that there is no definite set of laws of conduct that regulate human life.  Denies that there is no definite set of laws of behavior that regulate human life.

-   It follows that humans are machines as much as computers.

### Lady Lovelace’s Objection

Objection: Machines have “no pretensions to *originate
anything*. It can do *whatever we know how to order it to perform*.”

Response: The objection assumes that machines cannot learn. But it is possible for machines to learn.

### Digital Computer

A Digital Computer is a machine intended to carry out any operation which could be done by a human computer. It has three parts. 

Store:
: a bank of information. It iss like the paper or book that a human computer uses when doing their calculations.

Executive unit:
: carries out the various operations.

Control:
:   is like the rules or instructions for carrying out the calculation. Its job is to ensure that instructions are  obeyed correctly and in the right order.

Notice that we can dramatically increase the size and power of these three parts. So even if we don’t yet have a powerful enough computer that passes the Turing Test, we might build one by increasing the power and size of these parts.
