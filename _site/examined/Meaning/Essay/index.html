        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Flex your imagination. You are a dragon living in a comfortable well, which strangers sometimes fall down when they are not watching their path ahead. The well is also nice and slippy; you have yet to see anyone climb up who has fallen down. One day, a particularly plump academic type falls down below. Unfortunately for you, your potential dinner grabs onto some tree roots sticking out of the well wall. So frustrating! He also seems to love honey, which is annoying given that some honey is trickling down those roots. You wish he would hurry up. Of course, the roots will break when your allies, those mice, nibble through them. But that takes too long. You are hungry now! So, you try to persuade the victim to drop below to your waiting jaws.</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Pretending to be the dragon, use Tolstoy’s argument that life is meaningless to convince the person clinging to the wall to let go. Your submission must include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must explain Tolstoy’s argument that life is meaningless.</li>
  <li>This explanation must include a discussion of the difference between internal and external value.</li>
  <li>You should not repeat the examples from the textbook and notes; develop your own examples.</li>
  <li>You should submit an original presentation and discussion of the argument. You will be severely penalized if you merely quote long passages from the reading or notes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Failure to include any of these elements in your dialog will lose you points.</p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>Your dialog must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Please submit the file as a docx, rtf, or pdf.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Please find the rubric and explanation of it <a href="/resources/grading/">here</a>.</p>
