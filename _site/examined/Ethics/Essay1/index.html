<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and others.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charitably explaining arguments about issues of public importance.</li>
  <li>Understanding that there are different cultural norm and how those norms guide different behavior.</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>500-750. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus and course website for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>
