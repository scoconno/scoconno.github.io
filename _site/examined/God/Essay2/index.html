        <p><strong>NB: This essay examines your understanding of chapter 2.3 <em>God and the Problem of Evil</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Your boat!  A terrible hurricane destroyed your fishing boat, your ownly source of income. You paid decent money to insure that boat, but now the insurance company is refusing to compensate you; they claim that hurricanes are ‘acts of God’ that are not covered by the policy.</p>

<p>What nonsense! You sue the insurance company and argue in court that God does not exist, and so God could not be the cause of the hurricane. Your argument is that the existence of evil proves that an all good, all powerful, all knowing God does not exist at all. Thus, the insurance company should compensate you.</p>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Write the transcript of your closing statement (speech). This should be a word to word report of what you intend to say.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A closing statement is a speech the lawyer makes to the court. They address the jurors, the judge, the audience. You must write this as a <strong>speech!</strong> Points will be deducted if you do not follow this part of the prompt.</li>
</ul>

<p>The transcript must include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A detailed explanation of the ‘The Problem of Evil’. Do not use any other argument against God’s existence.</li>
  <li>Your explanation must explain what it is for God to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent.</li>
  <li>Your explanation must explain why a God with these features would prevent the hurricane. Explain why the fact that the hurricane happened is evidence that no such God exists.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Do not attempt to defend the insurance company. Do not try refute this argument. This exercise tests your ability to explain the problem of evil. It is not asking for you to find flaws with it.</p>

<h2 id="word-count">Word Count</h2>

<p>Your speech must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>
