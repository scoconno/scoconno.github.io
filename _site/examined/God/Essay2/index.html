        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>You are a court official. Your job is to keep detailed records of what everyone says in court. You are working on an unusual case. The plaintiff, named Ted, lost his fishing boat during a terrible hurricane. The insurance company refused to compensate Ted because they claimed the hurricane was an ‘act of God’.</p>

<p>Ted sues the insurance company. He argues that the hurricane and its evils prove that an all good, all powerful, all knowing God does not exist at all. And, since such a God does not exist, the insurance company cannot claim that the hurricane was an act of God. Thus, he claims, the insurance company should compensate him.</p>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write the transcript of Ted’s closing statement (speech). This should be a word to word report of what he said.
    <ul>
      <li>A closing statement is a speech the lawyer makes to the court. They address the jurors, the judge, the audience. You must write this as a <strong>speech!</strong> Points will be deducted if you do not follow this part of the prompt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The transcript must include his reasons for thinking that God does not exist.
    <ul>
      <li>Use the argument called ‘The Problem of Evil’. Do not use any other argument against or for God’s existence.</li>
      <li>You will need to explain what it is for God to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent. Explain why a God with these features would prevent the hurricane. Explain why the fact that the hurricane happened is evidence that no such God exists.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do not attempt to defend the insurance company. This exercise tests your ability to explain Ted’s argument. It is not asking for your personal opinion on the issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="word-count">Word Count</h3>

<p>Your speech must be 500-750 words long. Essays shorter than 500 words or longer than 750 words will lose points.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Please review the plagiarism policy on the syllabus. It is critical that you prepare your assignment by yourself. Use only the textbook and handouts—it will take you less time to work through these materials than to find and read other sources. I will be checking for significant overlaps between submission as well as checking answers against Wikipedia, internet search results, standard essay sites, etc. If you include material in your essay without citing it, you will receive 0 for the assignment. A second violation will result in a 0 for the course, a report to the Dean, and a petition for a note to be added to your permanent academic record.</p>

<h3 id="due-date">Due Date</h3>
<p>Please consult the syllabus for the due date.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Per the policies outlined in the syllabus, late work will not be accepted. Any request for special treatment will be ignored. If you foresee difficulties submitting work on time, either because of personal or work commitments, then you should start this paper early and submit it early.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Please submit the file as either a word file.</p>
