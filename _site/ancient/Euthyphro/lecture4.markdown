Euthyphro
=====================

#### Basic Philosophical Questions####

Murder was a religious offense, since it entailed 'pollution' which if not ritually purified was displeasing to the gods; but equally, a son's taking such action against his father might well itself be regarded as 'impious'.

S & E agree that one's knowledge of what is pious should underwrite your judgments about what is and is not pious. 

> Socrates: Whereas, by Zeus, Euthyphro, you think that your knowledge of the divine, and of piety and impiety, is so accurate that, when those things happened as you say, you have no fear of having acted impiously in bringing your father to trial?
> Euthyphro: I should be of no use, Socrates, and Euthyphro would not be superior to the majority of men, if I did not have accurate knowledge
of all such things.
> For, they say, it is impious for a son to prosecute his father for murder. But their ideas of the divine attitude to piety and impiety are wrong, Socrates.

- Should you testify against a loved one? 

- If your family member broke the law, would you turn them in? Why, why not?  Use a very classic example. 

- You then want, ultimately, to ask them how Socrates would think through the issue. 

- Socratic methodology, elenchus
- Euthyphro problem


> So tell me now, by Zeus, what you just now maintained you clearly knew: what kind of thing do you say that godliness and ungodliness are, both as regards murder and other things; or is the pious not the same and alike in every action, and the impious the opposite of all that is pious and like itself, and everything that is to be impious presents us with one form or appearance in so far as it is impious? (5D)


'What is ... ?' questions he pursues in other dialogues. He wants a single 'model' or 'standard' he can look to in order to determine which acts and persons are pious, one that gives clear, unconflicting, and unambiguous answers. He wants something that can provide such a standard all on its own-as one of Euthyphro's proposals, that being pious is simply being loved by the gods, cannot do, since one needs to know first what the gods do love. Pious acts and people may indeed be loved by the gods, but that is a secondary quality, not the 'essence' of piety-it is not that which serves as the standard being sought.



#### Basic Structure of *Euthyphro*  ####


-   2a–4a: Socrates encounters Euthyphro, who is about to
    prosecute his (E’s) father for murder.

-   4a–5d: S claims that only someone with expertise about piety,
    crucially including knowledge of its nature, should be confident
    that he were not acting impious in prosecuting a relative

-   5d–15d: E offers various candidates for the definition of
    piety, all of which S rejects

-   15d–end: S requests to start from the beginning, E refuses,
    leaves


#### Socrates’ method ####


-   S gets E to offer a candidate, C, as a definition of
    piety

-   S then elicits further claims that seem to entail that C is
    not, in fact, the definition of piety

-   What do S’s rejections of E’s various candidates tell us about what S thinks would be a *satisfactory* answer to the question “What is Piety?”?


####  Candidates for the definition of piety (*to hosion*) and Socrates’ objections 

1. 5e: Prosecuting the wrongdoer (regardless of personal
    relationship to wrongdoer)</span>

    -   <span>This is an *example* of a (kind of) pious action, not a specification of that in virtue of which all pious actions are pious</span>

-   <span> 7a: What is dear to the gods</span>

    -   <span>If the gods disagree on important ethical matters (as
        Euth. agrees they do at 6c and 7b–8a), then one and the same
        thing could be both pious (because dear to some god(s)) and
        impious (because hated by some other god(s)), but that is
        impossible</span>

-   <span> (modification of [2]) 9e: What is dear to *all* the
    gods</span>

    -   <span>This only gives us a quality or affection of piety, it
        does not tell us what piety is</span>

-   <span> 12e: The part of justice concerned with the care of the
    gods</span>

    -   <span>Care for *X* aims at benefitting *X* or making *X* better;
        But gods cannot be made better</span>

-   <span> 13d: The part of justice concerned with service to the
    gods</span>

    -   <span>Service aims at some goal (e.g. service to generals aims
        to help them win wars, service to house builders aims to help
        them build houses) but Euth. can’t specify what “fine thing”
        gods achieve such that service could aim to help them achieve
        that goal</span>

-   <span> (modification of [5]) 14d: = Knowledge of how to
    sacrifice and pray</span>

    -   <span>This definition reduces to [3] and the claim that
        sacrifices and prayers are dear to all the gods</span>


####Analyses####
A successful analysis must be: (1) fully general and univocal; (2) epistemically serviceable; and (3) more than extensionally adequate.


Univocal: there is a single unified definition or analysis for the qualities of concern to him. He recognizes that both a lion and a soldier can be brave.



#### Socrates’ rejection of [3]: Piety = What is dear to all the gods (10a-11b)####


-   Socrates asks “Is the pious loved by the gods because it’s
    pious? Or is it pious because it’s loved?”

-   Distinction between something’s being *X*ed and something’s
    *X*ing (e.g. something’s being carried and something’s carrying; being led and leading; being seen and seeing)

    -  S claims that something *X*ing *Y* is prior to *Y*’s being
        *X*ed

        -   E.g. If we ask “Why is this piece of chalk being
            carried (led, seen)?” the answer is “Because Professor
            Schwab is carrying (leading, seeing) it”</span>

        -   <span>If we ask “Why is Professor Schwab carrying this piece
            of chalk?” the answer is *not* “Because the piece of chalk
            is being carried by Professor Schwab”</span>

-   <span>So, by analogy, something’s being loved by the gods is
    *posterior* to the gods’ loving it (i.e. the fact that the gods love
    it explains why it is being loved, not the other way around)</span>

-   <span>If we ask, “Why do the gods love it?”, the answer is, “Because
    it is pious” and *not* “Because it is loved by the gods” (remember
    the carrying of the chalk: the answer to “Why is Professor Schwab
    carrying the chalk” was not “Because the chalk is being carried by
    Professor Schwab”)</span>

-   <span>But, as we saw above, the answer to “Why is it god-loved?” is
    “Because the Gods love it”</span>

-   <span>But if “To be pious” and “To be God-loved” were the same thing
    (as E claims), then:</span>

    -   <span>If the pious were loved because it’s pious, [by
        substituting identicals], the god-loved would be loved because
        it’s god-loved</span>

    -   <span>But, we’ve shown that to be impossible</span>

-   <span>Therefore: To be pious is not the same as To be dear to the gods</span>

S’s question: “Is the pious loved by the gods because it’s pious? Or is
it pious because it’s loved?” (10a), is about the “order of
explanation,” “priority,” or “fundamentality” of the relevant phenomena.

He ultimately claims that the fact that a certain action is pious
explains why (all) the gods love it, and not the other way round. This
is why S says that E has identified (at best) a quality of piety, not
the nature of piety.

**“Euthyphro Dilemma”**: If certain actions were pious (right, wrong,
obligatory, impermissible, etc.) *because* they are dear to the gods (or
commanded but God/the gods, etc.), we would ask why the gods love what
they love. Either it is [A] *arbitrary* what the gods love, or [B] the
gods love what they do for *reasons*. Either way, trouble looms:

-   <span>[A] seems absurd (it is just obviously false that if the gods
    had happened to love rape, murder, etc. then rape, murder, etc.
    would be pious)</span>

-   <span>If [B], it is the features of the actions in virtue of which
    the gods love them that explains why they are pious. The attitude of
    the gods is not what *explains* or *makes it the case* that they are
    pious</span>
